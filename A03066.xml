            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I formerly obeyed my friends, who thought the firſt too ſhort; this then may prove the happier, ſince I have laboured to give them a ready acknowledgement.

               <hi>Pen-gwin</hi> Ile is 6 or 7 leagues from the continent, which when wee got afterne we grew becalm'd, land-lockt in a ſort, and were ſported all the way (till we dropt anchor) by Whales, the Seas Leviathan, who after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thundred our welcome into <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> fuzzing or ſpouting part of the briny Ocean in wantonneſſe out of their oylie pipes bored by nature a top their prodigious ſhoulders, like ſo many floating Ilands concomitating us.</p>
            <p>The 1. of <hi>Iuly</hi> wee anchor'd with ſafety in the <hi>Soldania</hi> Bay, 12 leagues ſhort of the utmoſt Cape: a Road worthily cald <hi>good Hope,</hi> by King <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. of <hi>Portugall</hi> rejecting that of Tempeſtuous firſt impoſed by <hi>Gama;</hi> in that if any attaine hither, their <hi>Indian</hi> voyage is halfe done, and the other part leſſe ſolitary, ſo many excellent Ilands entertaining them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Soldania</hi> Bay is of a ſemi-lunary forme; large and ſafe; high, 5 or 6 miles from the ſea; towards the ſhoare, low and fruitfull. Where we pitch our Tents, is a ſmall ſtreame of Chryſtallin water, exceeding ſweet, trickling from

Yet of late they have got hoopes of iron, and long links of braſſe, graſſe wreathes, or greaſie thongs of ſtinking leather. Their armes are loaden with voluntary ſhackles of iron, Jvory, ruſty braſſe, or muſty copper. The reſt of their bodies are naked, ſave that a thong or girdle of raw leather circles them, a ſquare peece (like the back of a Glove) is faſtned to it, ſerving to cover their <hi>pudenda.</hi> But I cannot commend their modeſty, the women (upon receipt of any thing) returning her gratitude by diſcovering her ſhame, a curteſie taught them by ſome ill-bred Boore, our men I hope have more civility.

            <p>The <hi>Bannyans</hi> (or <hi>Vanyans</hi>) are tawny of complexion, faire ſpoken, crafty, and above meaſure ſuperſtitious; they let their haire grow long, their head is covered with a ſmall wreath or ſhaſh for the moſt part white; their habit, a long coat or veſt of white quilted Callico of the Dalmatick ſort; their ſhooes are variable in colour and faſhion; ſome checkerd and ingraled in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant order, wrought to each mans ingenious fancy; with out latchets, ſharp and turning up at the toe, thin ſol'd, high heeld, ſurrounded with ſteele, faſt and durable: The women are whiter than the men, yet want the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine mixture to adorne them, which they ſupply by Art, there being found the beſt vermilion: they weare their haire long and diſheveled; part obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a fine thin Lawne, by whoſe tranſparency it ſeemes more lovely; their eares, noſes, armes, and legs, are loaden with many voluntary rings and fetters of Braſſe, Gold and Ivory; their behaviour is ſilently modeſt, but full gorg'd with libidinous fantaſies and diſtempers. Marriage is ſo honored, that they contract at 7 commonly, and at 10 yeeres old are often parents: but if an infant die ere he be married, the parents of him that dyed procure ſome virgin or other (to whom they give ſome <hi>Dynaes</hi> of Gold in lieu of Ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture) to be his bed-fellow one night, to avoid the reproachfull proverb, <hi>he dyed unmarried.</hi>

Their Funeralls are of the old ſtamp (recorded by <hi>Curtius</hi>) ſacring the corps to aſhes in a holy fire, compounded of all ſorts of coſtly woods and Aromatick ſpices: the wife alſo (in expectation to enjoy her husband 'mongſt incomparable pleaſures) inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops her dainty body with the mercileſſe flames, for which kindneſſe ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a living memory.

               <note place="margin">Religion of the Banny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note>The <hi>Bannyan</hi> religion at this day, is of theſe Tenents. That the whole frame or body of the world had a beginning, created by a God of immenſe power, eternall and provident: that after he had made man, to aſſociate him created woman to ſimpathize in ſimilitude of body, and diſpoſition. Theſe be named <hi>Pourous</hi> and <hi>Parcouty,</hi> a coople ſo innnocent, and contented, that they had no ill thoughts, but fed only upon herbs and fruits, not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought had bloud or life in it. From this chaſt couple ſprung two couple of boyes, the Embleams of the foure complexions, <hi>Brammon, Cuttery, Shuddery,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe.</hi> Of different conſtitutions. <hi>Bramon</hi> melancholy, <hi>Cuttery</hi> chollerick, <hi>Shudddery</hi> flegmatick; and <hi>Wiſe</hi> ſanguin: Each affecting his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall calling. The firſt a Prieſt, the ſecond a Warrior, the third a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, the laſt a Peſant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brammon</hi> the Prieſt (from whom the <hi>Brahman</hi> have their title, and not from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Keturah,</hi> as <hi>Poſtellus</hi> thinketh) was commanded (ſayes their <hi>Shaſter</hi> or booke of lawes) to travell Eaſt to finde a wife; it being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him, that God had formed foure women for him and his brethren, on whom to propagate; (for the reaſon they had no ſiſters to generate upon, was, becauſe ſo pure and holy a race as they, ſhould not diſcend from filthy Inceſt.) After long and tedious pilgrimage and much prayer, he eſpies his long lookt for Virgin, cloathed with naked innocence, her face yellow like gold, her hayre and eyes black, of a compleat ſtature, who without much courting he won and marryed: this Lady <hi>Savatree</hi> proved the mother of a holy generation. <hi>Cuttery</hi> was ſent weſt to find his mate, his ſword in's hand, habited after his nature, all the while fretting for want of reſiſtance, and that his patience was ſo long trod upon: at length, he eſpies a farre off one comming towards him, aequally inflamed with impatience; without much complement, they forthwith aſſailed each other, with ſuch fury, and ſo much bravery, that the firſt dayes fight the victory was not to be decided; next day, they renew their courage, giving and receiving wounds
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20354:26"/>
inſenſibly, till in concluſion <hi>Cuttery</hi> grapled, and ſeiz'd <hi>Toddicaſtree</hi> by the treſſes of her haire, but inſtead of ſubjecting her, is (by the freſh out breaking of her beauty) captivated; yet after ſubmiſſion and repentance for his rage againſt ſuch an earthly Angell, ſhee is reconcil'd, and from them the Weſt ſwarmed with a generation of Radiaes and Souldiers. <hi>Shuddery</hi> the third ſonne of <hi>Pourous</hi> and <hi>Parcouty,</hi> travell North in equall hope to find his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe; farre he went and many ſtrange adventures paſſed thorow and ſaw, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that rock of Diamonds he alight on, many of which (as any other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant would have done) he carried along with him, enamoured of their luſtre and ſparkling excellencies: till at laſt he alſo met <hi>Viſagundah,</hi> whom he ſoone woone, being of a tractable ſweet nature and condition, (as be all the <hi>Bannyan</hi> daughters deſcended from her) and of her begot ſo many ſonnes, that the North quickly became pregnant and inhabited. Now come we to <hi>Wyſe</hi> (the ſimpleſt of Sir <hi>Pourous</hi> ſonnes) a man of much plaine honeſty and comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Southward goes hee, having ſtrange intelligence that his female was thereabouts, whom (after he had paſſed ſeven Seas (the breadth and way is concealed in the <hi>Shaſter</hi>) and built him a faire Manſion, whither <hi>Iejunogundah</hi> (his future wife) came to admire ſo rare a ſtructure; he ſaw her, &amp; not knowing how to court her, is o'recome with Loves paſſion; but long time is rejected and thought baſely of, till (by divine providence) ſhee is mollified and made to yeeld, upon condition, hee ſhould build many Pagods or Idols for Gods worſhip, and adore pictures under greene Trees and under Arbours, which to this day, his poſterity obſerve ceremoniouſly. Thus from theſe two the South was filled with mechanick men, and ſuch as practize tillage and husbandry.</p>
            <p>When theſe foure young men had ſpent ſome yeares in thoſe contrary quarters of the world, whither Fate had directed them. All foure becam equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindfull of their firſt home, deſirous to viſit their aged parents, not onely to propagate there alſo, and furniſh that Meditallium of the earth, but alſo to recount their memorable fortunes and adventures. After much circumſtance and toile they arrived at the place from whence they came, each of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a troope of their owne younglins: tis in vaine to decipher the joy and mutuall embraces twixt them and their aged Parents, revived by this good hap from the benumming Froſt of old age; as alſo the reciprocall kindneſſe and love amongſt the 4 Travellers, a dull ſenſe may eaſily comprehend, it was without all mixture of diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent or malady. Notwithſtanding, to ſhew, no <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum</hi> can be had in this life, in proceſſe of time (the iſſue of theſe foure multiplying) the world began to loſe her virgin purity and candor; diſcord, pride, and rapine mingling amongſt them, whereby all brotherly love was layd aſide, and no appearance now but of violence &amp; voluptuouſneſſe: <hi>Bramon</hi> growes idle and careleſſe in his devotion. <hi>Cuttery</hi> becomes inſolent and aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, regarding neither the venerable advice &amp; admonition of his Parents, nor the dignity of <hi>Bramon</hi> his elder brother. <hi>Shuddery</hi> alſo invents deceit, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding juſtice nor equity, but delights in cheating his other brethren. <hi>Wyſe</hi> alſo growes unthrift in a good conſcience, baniſhing his innate honeſty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine ryot: For which, his cruell brother <hi>Cuttery</hi> domineeres and makes an Aſſe of him, impoſing ſuch taxes and burdens on that ſilly Countryman, that <hi>Wyſe</hi> is now the object of caſheered ryot, and the abject of his Lordly brother; who alſo picks a quarell with <hi>Shuddery,</hi> and admits not of any recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,

till the poore Merchant had ſatisfied his Avarice with halfe his ſtore; ſo that ſuch hate and feare grew amongſt 'em, that all their Deſignes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in a dark Chaos of confuſion. But though deceit, ryot, and tyrannie ſway a while, an all-ſeeing Majeſty ſits above, who in his owne time retaliates in the extremity of juſtice. And ſo it now hapned: for upon a ſudden, when they were moſt buſied in their villany and leaſt dreame of account, God roab's himſelfe with clouds and flaſhes terrour, whereat the ſeas multiply their noiſe, and ſwell ſo formidably, that they threaten an univerſall deluge and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: In the interim the amazed people are confounded with ſuch horrible cracks of thunder, and ſuch thick flaſhes of flame and lightning, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes of the earth ſeemed to gaſpe and quake with terrour and feare: which done, in a moment the ſea breaks ore her bounds, and ſweepes away in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall darkneſſe and ſilence all creatures on the earth, purging away that naſty ſmell of their late wickedneſſe and pollution.</p>
            <p>But God who delights in Mercy, and grieves at any mans confuſion, repents him of his ſeverity, and reſolves againe to furniſh the earth with a new gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men repleat with more purity, mercy and perfection. To which end he deſcends, and upon a very high mountaine call'd <hi>Meropurbateé</hi> commands <hi>Bremaw</hi> to riſe up, who (though till then not created) obeyed and worſhipped his Maker. In like ſort at two other calls, came up <hi>Viſtney</hi> and <hi>Kuddery,</hi> who performed equall obeyſance. <hi>Bremaw</hi> (to avoyd ſloath) has power to create all other creatures. <hi>Viſtney</hi> has order given to preſerve them; and <hi>Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery</hi> has ſtrength to maſſacre and be Gods executioner by way of death, plague, famine, diſeaſes, warre, or the like. And according to this appointment, theſe three new created Lords performe and regard their particular affaires, to each of them a ſet period of time being alotted to live on earth. <hi>Bremaw</hi> at the end of the ſecond Age in a fiery chariot was elevated. <hi>Viſtney</hi> ſtayes double his time and then departs, leaving the iſſue to <hi>Ruddery,</hi> (at the end of three times ſo long commorance) to deſtroy the world, and to tranſlate the ſoules of good men into a garden of moſt raviſhing delights and glory. But ere this were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, It is fit to acquaint you that how <hi>Bremaw</hi> came to furniſh the earth with more Inhabitants. The <hi>Shaſter</hi> or their Cabaliſticall <hi>Thalmud</hi> tells us, that as <hi>Bremaw</hi> was ruminating how to act it, ſuddenly he fell into a trance, and upon recovery felt his body troubled beyond meaſure, purporting ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate chance or alteration. Nor did his thoughts deceive him; for loe, forthwith his body begun to ſwell, yea ſo great anguiſh to afflict him, that in all points it reſembled a womans travaile, and indeed it had Analogie, in that his bowels began to extend more and more and his dolour to encreaſe, till (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much toyle) the ſecond ſwellings found vent, broke, and deliver'd their burthen, two faire Twins, one of each ſex whom hee needed not to give ſuck unto, in that by like miracle they immediatly grew up to a perfect ſtature, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with language, and many ſymptomes of education; <hi>Bremaw</hi> the Parent named them <hi>Manaw</hi> and <hi>Ceteroupa,</hi> whom after hee had bleſſed, he ſent Eaſt to the great mountaine <hi>Mounder purvool,</hi> where ſtrait way Miſtreſſe <hi>Ceteroupa</hi> brought forth three ſonnes and ſo many daughters: The Boyes ſhe call'd, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auretta, Outanapautha,</hi> and <hi>Soomeraut.</hi> The Girles <hi>Cammah, Sounerettaw,</hi> and <hi>Sumboo:</hi> The eldeſt ſonne and daughter went Weſt to a huge mountaine <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gund.</hi> The two ſeconds North, to <hi>Bipola:</hi> The two laſt of each ſex to <hi>Suparr,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:20354:27"/>
where they ſo generated, that they quickly peopled each their quarter. Which done, God perceiving the hearts of men enclined to vice and all ſorts of vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to give them directions how to live vertuouſly and avoyd temptation, he left heaven a while and alighted on the high Mount <hi>Meropurbatee,</hi> whither he call'd <hi>Bremaw,</hi> to whom hee ſpake many things out of a dusky dark cloud or miſt, now and than flaſhing ſome glimpſes of his Majeſty, acquainting him why he deſtroy'd the firſt world, their ſinnes provoking him, and how deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous he was, never to doe ſo againe: and to that end deliver'd <hi>Bremaw</hi> a Book (the <hi>Shaſter</hi> by name) fill'd with excellent ſtories, divided into three Tracts, dedicated to the three great Caſts or Tribes: the firſt containing Morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: the ſecond, the ceremonies of their Worſhip: the third, a diviſion of them into three, with peculiar notes and inſtructions to each Caſt or Tribe.</p>
            <p>Their Morall law (read and taught them by <hi>Bremaw</hi> out of the <hi>Shaſter</hi>) has eight commandements.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou ſhalt not kill nor deſtroy any living creature, for thou and it are both my creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou ſhalt not ſinne in any of thy five ſenſes: thy eyes not beholding vanity: thy eares to be ſtopt in hearing evill: thy tongue not to utter any fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe: thy pallat hating wine, fleſh, and all other vive things: thy hands ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring things defiled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou ſhalt duly performe the ſet times of devotion, praying, waſhing, elevating, proſtrating, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thou ſhalt not lie nor diſſemble.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thou ſhalt not be hard hearted, but helpfull to others.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thou ſhalt not oppreſſe nor tyrannize.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thou ſhalt obſerve certaine Feſtivalls and faſting dayes:</p>
            <p n="8">8. Thou ſhalt not ſteale.</p>
            <p>Theſe eight precepts are ſub-divided into foure: each of the foure old Caſts retaining them. <hi>Bramon</hi> and <hi>Shuddery,. i.e.</hi> the <hi>Braminy</hi> and <hi>Bannyan</hi> are tyed to moſt ſevere and ſtrict obſervance in the decorum of their worſhip. <hi>Cuttery</hi> and <hi>Wyſe. i.e.</hi> the Juſtice and Labourer agree in theirs. From whence the Prieſt and Merchants (appropriating the firſt and ſecond to themſelves) are more ſuperſtitious, than the two other Caſts of Souldiers and Mechanicks, who aſſume a great liberty in meats and wine. Notwithſtanding, all of them beleeve the Metempſychoſis of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whoſe conceits we will parallel by and by with theſe Bannyans. In this place drawing your judgement to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what is already related: wherein, we may perceive the deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sathan charmes them with, whoſe cuſtome it has ever been to erect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe worſhip and Idolatry in ſome things (to make 'em more authenticall) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering with the Story of our Bible, and in imitation of the Jewes: and that this <hi>Cabala</hi> or <hi>Shaſter</hi> of the Bannyans is a depraved Story of the Bible, either obtain'd by ſome Jewes, ſuch time as <hi>Solomon</hi> traded to <hi>Ophyr</hi> (neere theſe parts) or from the father of lyes, who peradventure did dictate it for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. For in the <hi>Shaſter,</hi> ſpeaking of the Creation of the world out of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> and forming of <hi>Pourous</hi> and <hi>Parcoutee</hi> ſucceſſively: who is ſo blind that ſees not the making of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve:</hi> the other of the Creation (delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi>) ſhadowed in't: the univerſall deluge and deſtruction of mankind pointing out that of <hi>Noah?</hi> By <hi>Bremaws</hi> receiving the Law from God (in a dark cloud and

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bannyans</hi> are commanded (as in moſt hot Countries in all other Pagan Religious is obſerved) to waſh often. Firſt, dawbing their naked bodies with dirt and mud (the Embleam of ſinne) then, diving three times in the water, their faces to the Eaſt, ſhaking a few graines of Rice as a Thankſgiving to that element for purging them: A three-fold ducking and tripartite thred is hung at three holes in a ſtone about the neck, the Rice fixed in their forehead each morne in an unguent of red paint, is a Symbol of Baptiſme: Their turning to the Eaſt, in memory of the judgement and creation, and to adore the Sun and Moone, in that they take them to be Gods eyes, full of purity, heat and nurture. But this their attending the bluſhing Sunne at his ariſing, the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their hands, murmurs, plaſhing the water in Magick order, diving, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and acting other promiſcuous foperies, heare them condemned by a neighbour of theirs <hi>Iob,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But above all, their horrid Idolatry to Pagods (or Images of deformed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils) is moſt obſervable: Placed in Chappels moſt commonly built under the Bannyan Trees (or that which <hi>Linſchot</hi> call'd <hi>Arbor de Rays</hi> or tree of roots, Sir <hi>Wal. Ral.</hi> improperly <hi>Ficus Indicus</hi>) a tree of ſuch repute amongſt 'em, that they hold it impiety to abuſe it, either in breaking a branch or otherwiſe, but contrarily adorne it with Streamers of ſilk and ribbons of all colours. The Pagods are of ſundry ſorts and reſemblances, in ſuch ſhape as Satan viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares unto them: ugly faced, long black haire, gogl'd eyes, wide mouth, a forked beard, hornes and ſtradling, miſhapen and horrible, after the old filthy forme of <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Priapus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under theſe holy Trees they ſit and actuate their Idolatrous devotion: there they pay their Tythes and Offrings, there receive the ſacred unction and ſprinklings of ſundry colour'd powders: there they performe their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which they denotate by the wooden ſound of a little Bell: there they repeat their Orizons, make Proceſſions, ring their Bells, ſing and performe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny myſteries; yea, ſo numerous grew their Idoll Temples, that (till the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmen mixt among them) each Village had its ſeverall Pagods, and many to this day are ſtanding.

This done, the Bramyn bleſſes them, prayes that ſhe may prove as gentle and fruitfull as a Cow, the cloath is torne away, the ſtring untyed, and they are one anothers ever after.

            <p>The concluſion is, that all theſe 4 Caſts in time grew ſo impious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, that God commanded <hi>Ruddery</hi> to command a blaſt of wind to ſweep away this wretched generation, which accordingly he did; that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt raging ſo violently that the mountaines and rocks were hurled to and fro like duſt or tenniſ-balls, the ſeas out of their courſe, yea <hi>Ganges</hi> out of her holy channell, wherein all (ſave a few honeſt men and women left to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh) periſhed; this was the ſecond confuſion.

            </p>
            <p>But to ſhew the imbecillity of mans nature, his weak condition and frailty: in proceſſe of time the world again grew abominable and treacherous: ſo that <hi>Ruddery</hi> commands the earth to open and ſwallow down quick thoſe ungodly wretches; a few excepted, who the third time peopled the earth with humane inhabitants, and then (as <hi>Bremaw</hi> had formerly) <hi>Viſtney</hi> the mediator of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy aſcended into heaven, leaving cruell <hi>Ruddery</hi> to over rule this age of Iron, at the end of which he alſo ſhall be rapt into paradiſe: theſe 4 ages they call <hi>Curtain, Duauper, Tetrajoo</hi> and <hi>Kolee.</hi>

            <p>Touching the laſt Iudgement, they hold it ſhall be more dreadfull than the other; the Moone to look blood red, the Sunne to ſhed his light like purling brimſtone, an univerſall flaſhing of fire, with loudeſt thundring; then a flammy redneſſe will oreſpread the heavens, and the 4 Elements (of which the world conſiſts) ſhall maintaine a dreadfull fight ſo long, ſo fiercely one againſt another, that at laſt all ſhall be revolved into a dark confuſion: the ſoules of ſuch as were good men, <hi>Ruddery</hi> will tranſport to heaven, the wicked periſh; but the bodies of both riſe no more, being too incredulous of the reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Now albeit theſe people in a continued ſeries of wilfulneſſe and ignorance beleeve that their <hi>Shaſter</hi> or <hi>Cabala</hi> was immediately from God, yet that it is wholly grounded upon tradition, and parched out of many Hiſtories, Iewiſh and Gentiliſme, I have already ſhewed what is in imitation of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and from the rule and practiſe of other Nations: and we may adde, that their burning the dead, is borrowed from the 6 of <hi>Amos</hi> 10. their marriage after death from <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>Marcyon,</hi> old hereticks who uſed to baptize after death in caſe they were not pre-baptiz'd; the thred tripartite hung about their neck is a miſterious denotation of the Trinity; rice and painting in their forehead is not only as a ſymbole of Baptiſme, but in imitation of the Starre <hi>Rempham</hi> fixed in the brow of the Idoll <hi>Moloch,</hi> or of <hi>Iul.

            <p>They are tollerated all ſorts of meat; but (in obedience to the Mahomitan and Bannyan 'mongſt whom they live) refraine Beefe and Hog fleſh: they ſeldome feed together, leſt they might participate one anothers impurity: each has his owne cap; and if any of his owne Caſt chance to uſe it, hee waſhes it three times, and forbeares it a good while after: they obſerve ſix ſolemne Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivalls annually; the firſt call'd <hi>Meduſerum,</hi> kept the 15 of <hi>Fere</hi> or <hi>February;</hi> 2. <hi>Petuſahan,</hi> on the 26 of <hi>Sheruar</hi> or <hi>Aprill;</hi> 3. <hi>Yatrum,</hi> on the 26 of <hi>Mahar</hi> or <hi>May;</hi> 4. <hi>Medearum,</hi> on the 16 of <hi>Deh</hi> or <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 5. <hi>Homeſpetamadum,</hi> on the 30 of <hi>Spindamud</hi> or <hi>October;</hi> 6. <hi>Meduſan,</hi> on the 11 of <hi>Adebeſe</hi> or <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> all of them in memory of the Creation and monethly benefits. After each of theſe Feaſts they eat but one ſmall meale a day for five dayes after, and whenſoe're that lay men eat any fleſh, they bring part to their Eggaree or Temple to pacifie the Lord, in that for their ſuſtenance the lives of thoſe good creatures are annihilated. Now concerning the Fire they adore, tis in memory of that <hi>Zertooſt</hi> brought from heaven, wherein they memorize the veſtalls, or rather in an apiſh imitation of the Jewiſh law (the devill as neere as may be, deſiring to counterfeit the Law of God) in the 6. of <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. where tis commanded that the fire (that came from heaven) ſhould be ever burning upon the Altar and never goe out.

            <p>But if it chance the fire have need of cheriſhing, the Diſtoore and other Lay-men (at 12 foot diſtance) ſurround the holy Diety and after ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, the Prieſts adds fewell and returning to the other people, altogether worſhip it, beſeeching it, that they may not onely give it due reverence, but alſo honour ſolemnly all other things that reſemble it; as Sunne, Moon, Starrs, and common fire, which alſo they ſo divinely eſtimate, that they hold it a moſt ungodly part to ſpet in it, throw water into it, or put it to any vile or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary imployment; but reverence wood and ſuch things as it receives life and vigour from.</p>

            <p>Their Marriages in briefe are thus: diſtinguiſht into five orders. 1. <hi>Shaulan,</hi> or a marrying of two young children agreed on by each parents, but unknown to the children; the vertue being, that if either die they goe to heaven. 2. <hi>Chockerſon,</hi> a ſecond marriage. 3. <hi>Codeſherahaſan,</hi> when the woman is her owne chooſer. 4. <hi>Ecksan,</hi> when a dead body (not being married before) is married. 5. <hi>Ceterſon,</hi> when having no ſonnes, he adopts his daughters ſon, &amp;c. the Coremony this: at midnight the Daroo or Prieſt enters the houſe, (they wed not in Churches) finds the two parties (to be married) upon a bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; oppoſite to each other ſtands two Churchmen with Ryce in their hands (the Emblem of fruitfulneſſe:) then firſt, one laying his fore-finger on the Brides forehead, he asks if ſhe be willing to take that man to be her Husband, who ſaying yea: the like rite and queſtion is by the other Prieſt done to the man; the Bridegroome makes a promiſe to infeoff her in a certaine number of Dynaes: ſhe replyes, ſhe and all ſhe has is his; the Prieſts then ſcatter the Ryce upon their heads and pray, that they may multiply as Ryce; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans parents give the Dowry, and eight dayes are ſpent in joviality and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.</p>
            <p>Their Funeralls are theſe: They put the dead body into a winding ſheet, all the way his kindred beat themſelves but in great ſilence till they come within 50 or 100 paces of the buriall place: where the Herbood or Prieſt meets them (obſerving ten foot diſtance) attired in a yellow ſcarfe and a thin Turbant: the Neceſſelars or bearers carry the corps upon an iron Beere (wood is forbidden, in that it is ſacred to the fire) to a little Shed or Furnace, where (ſo ſoone as ſome miſtique Antiques are acted) they hoyſe it up to the top of a round ſtone building, twelve foot high and 80 in circuit: the entrance is only at the N. E. ſide, where through a ſmall grate or hole they conveigh the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe into a common Monument, the good men into one, the bad into another; tis flat above, wholy open, plaiſtered with ſmooth white loame, hard and ſmooth like that of Paris; in the midſt thereof is a hole deſcending to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, made to let in the putrifaction iſſuing from the melted bodies, which are there-upon layd naked in two rowes, expoſed to the Sunnes flaming rage,

and mercileſſe appetite of ravening Vultures, who commonly are fed by theſe carcaſes, tearing the raw fleſh aſunder, and deforming it in an ugly ſort; ſo that the abominable ſtink of thoſe unburied bodies (in ſome places 300) is ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſtrong, that (did not a deſire to ſee ſtrange ſights allure a Traveller) they would prove worſe ſeene than ſpoken of; Nor doe the Perſees delight that any ſtranger ſhould goe op to view them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Curroon</hi> amazedly perceives upon the ſudden his overthrow, and by and by has the reaſon of it. He does all hee can to alter their cowardize; he perſwades, threats, oppoſes, and cries aloud that he was living, yea a hundred Captaines as good as <hi>Byckermanſe</hi> were in the Army: but in vaine, for ſuch was their prepoſterous feare and diſorder, that he ſees it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to revoke them: ſo that (vollying one a thouſand curſes, expreſſing all ſymptomes of rage and frenzie) he rides to and fro, not knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had better here put a period (by his death) to all future misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or to fly and hope for better afterwards: at laſt, by <hi>Ganganna's</hi> advice he haſts away, but leaves his men and treaſure to the mercy of his enemies, and after long and ſwift flight with few of his freinds, attaines the deſolate and high Mountaines of <hi>Mewat,</hi> in whoſe ſolitary rocks hee ruminates his miſery and the juſtice of God upon his high rebellion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sultan Perwees</hi> with a glad heart meets his victorious Father at <hi>Balzol;</hi> after which the Seralios are freed, and the Caſtle gates opened, as fearleſſe of any more oppoſall. And now, the old <hi>Mogul</hi> cheeres up his late droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſpirits, and ſolaces himſelfe with <hi>Noormal,</hi> the light of his eyes, and the beſt object of his devotion: his delight and jocundities gave a faire occaſion to <hi>Aſſaph-cawn,</hi> and <hi>Ganganna,</hi> to mediate a reconciliation for <hi>Curroon;</hi> and which the old man alſo inclined to; ſo that; from <hi>Aſmeer,</hi> letters of peace and pardon are diſpacht unto the rebellious Prince; who reads them with no ſmall joy, and prepares for his ſubmiſſion: with <hi>Ganganna, Abdul cawn, Darab cawn, Beyram beg,</hi> and other Umbraves of quality, hee deſcends the Mountaines of <hi>Mewat,</hi> and through <hi>Baſſawer, Hambyer</hi> and <hi>Lael-ſod</hi> (unable to forbeare piltring all the way) at laſt hee came to <hi>Azmeer,</hi>

               <p>So ſoone as <hi>Rajea Bickermanſe</hi> was ſlaine, <hi>Curroon</hi> in his place made <hi>Abdul-cawn</hi> Governor of <hi>Guſurat, Amadavad</hi> and <hi>Cambaya. Abdul-cawn,</hi>

though glad of ſo high preferment delays his journey; both in regard of his deſire to ſee <hi>Curroon</hi> freed from his troubles, and to enjoy the command and gain he every day got in <hi>Curroons</hi> depredations: and obteyning leave to ſtay a while, he ſends his Eunuch <hi>Baffadur-cawn</hi> as his deputy to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his perſon, and to prepare things the better againſt his comming. The Eunuch in good equipage travels thither-ward, and by the inhabitants of <hi>Amadabat</hi> is received with much ſtate and ceremonie; but, beholding himſelfe mounted ſo high, incircled with ſuch rayes of Majeſty, &amp; roabed with ſo much honour, his former vaſſalage is forgotten, and his genius ſo tranſcendently efflated with pride and ambition, that he beholds his equals with diſdaine and anger, his inferiors with a ſquint and ſupercilious eye of ſcorne and tyranny: yet, ſuch as knew his feathers were but borrowed, and that his glory was but the reflect of him hee counterfeited, gave him occaſion to underſtand himſelfe, by affronts, neglect and undervaluing him; eſpecially <hi>Nadab-Tſaffi-chan</hi> the <hi>Moguls</hi> Chancellor, who by intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and threats ſought to reforme him, but by ſuch meanes more exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; ſo that after many baſe and contumelious uſages, hee is forced (to ſave his life) out of the City, but ſo inraged, that he vowes requitall: hee haſts to <hi>Nazar-cawn</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Patan</hi> and <hi>Baban-cawn</hi> of <hi>Chapperbenniz,</hi> whom by his complaints (and affront offered as he pretended to the <hi>Mogul</hi> their Maſter) hee inflames with fury; by this advantage alſo perceiving a way to defy <hi>Curroon</hi> their inveterate adverſary: for hearing the Eunuch had not above five hundred horſe, they preſently prepare, and advance to <hi>Amadavad</hi> with a thouſand horſe and five Elephants, and (by leave of ſome that hated the Eunuch) enter the Cicy, and commit what villany they pleaſe, force the Caſtle, and impriſon <hi>Baffador-cawn</hi> the Eunuch, with his branded aſſociates <hi>Mirza Madary, Motzab-cawn</hi> and <hi>Mamet-Haſſen</hi> the Cambayan Podeſtate, whom they diſgrace, and depart at pleaſure, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the City ſatisfied, and the Country full of amazement. But ere long, <hi>Curroon</hi> has notice of it, and (finding it a plot to diſhonour him) ſwells with rage, thunders out his diſcontent, and ſtraight way breaks out into rebellion. But <hi>Abdul-cawn</hi> ſcoffes at this accident, as unworthy <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roons</hi> impatience and his trouble, their Antagoniſts being but three, one of them a pallid Lawyer; the other two, Merchants of ſmall wealth or reputation.</p>
               <p>Yet knowing ſatisfaction would not be had without a combat, and that <hi>Saffi-cawn</hi> might not too long feed upon their miſery, hee convocates all his Umbraves, <hi>Amet-cawn,</hi> (Governour of <hi>Brodera</hi>) <hi>T'zalibeg, Ruſtan Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, Mamet-hoſſen, Mercon-beg, Zerdzie-cawn, Matzael-cawn</hi> and others; to each of whom he relates the Princes diſhonour and his owne griefe, not that hee feared ſuch meane enemies, but that herein hee ſaw the fire of more wrath and diſcord a kindling; which by the conſtancy and valour of theſe his friends hee doubted not to extinguiſh. They heare him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and profeſſe their loyalty: yea unanimouſly with ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand choyce horſe make haſte to chaſtiſe <hi>Saffi-chan</hi> &amp; his aſſociates: foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred thouſand roopees are disburſt by <hi>Abdul-cawn,</hi> to increaſe his army with ten thouſand infantery; ſo that now hee makes ſure to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, yea to extirpate the very memory of his enemies: indeed, many

ſwell themſelves with empty conceits and fancies, and by a fooliſh admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their own power and bravery, judge all attempts, though chargd with never ſo much danger, inferiour to their worth and fortune; but tne event oftentimes diſcovers their ſhallow imaginations, and makes them ridiculous. We ſee it ſo in this <hi>Abdul-cawn,</hi> a man of great power, credit, and experience; yet at this time ſo whirld, yea ſo efflated with pride and ſcorne, that (by too much ſecurity and contempt of thoſe hee was to grapple with) hee prepares his owne ruine. From <hi>Mandou</hi> with his Army, in five dayes hee comes to <hi>Brodera,</hi> and haſts thence to <hi>Waſſet,</hi> judging all <hi>Gujurat</hi> affrighted at his comming; but <hi>Saffi-cawn</hi> and his were nothing troubled at it; no, although <hi>Sultan-Bullochy</hi> and <hi>Cawn-Azem</hi> were then at <hi>Tſeroy</hi> a good way diſtant, nor that he wanted (the nerves of war) mony, and the people were (though his was the <hi>Moguls</hi> cauſe) neutrall and indifferent; but rather, inſpir'd with new courage and pollicy, throwes off all apparition of feare, and (to adde ſomewhat to his treaſury and pay) forrages ſuch Townes as refuſed to contribute, forces the Exchequer, and ſpoyles that rich and glorious throne or ſtate, <hi>Sultan Curroon</hi> had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet up in <hi>Amadavad,</hi> as an addition and monument of his glory; with this and his other helps he entertaines an Army of twenty thouſand horſe, five hundred Musketiers, thirty Elephants for warre; and (by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all his proviſion was in defence of <hi>Iangheers</hi> prerogatives) above twenty Umbraves of quality, <hi>Mirza Caſſen, Immirza Mockym, Radgea Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licawn, Radgee Doola, Commel-cawn, Gokeldas, Phereez-cawn, Tzedchan, Tzed Iacob</hi> &amp;c. aſſociate him, to <hi>Kanckry,</hi> where hee incampt, and thence to <hi>Aſſempore;</hi> where hearing of <hi>Abdul-cawns</hi> comming, hee aroſe and came to <hi>Boubentalow,</hi> ſix courſe from <hi>Amadavad;</hi> where in a valiant poſture, hee attended the comming of his enemies.</p>

The enſuing morne hee moves towards <hi>Kaviſe</hi> and there hearing how ſtrong the Enemy was (his opinion ſomewhat altered) he travels to <hi>Baroch</hi> thinking to aſſaile them in the reare, but in vaine, for they diſcovered him; ſo that next day he reſolved to encounter them in a maine battell, and accordingly at that time divides his Army into three; one, to <hi>Amet-cawn</hi> and <hi>Tzalibeg;</hi> another to <hi>Tzardi-cawn, Maxatbeg</hi> and <hi>Mamet-Cooly;</hi> and the laſt to himſelfe: and in this equipage, the whole Camp removed to <hi>Zietelpore</hi> and <hi>Phettibeg;</hi> where <hi>Nahar-cawn,</hi> his five ſonnes, and two ſonnes in law, <hi>Karamamet-cawn</hi> and <hi>Kamamet-cawn,</hi> with three thouſand horſe, begin the fight, and charge ſo hotly upon <hi>Abdul-cawns</hi> troops, that they made them retire and loſe their ground of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; beſides, they playd ſo fiercely on them with their Muskets, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20354:49"/>
they diſordered <hi>Abdul-cawns</hi> beſt cavalry, and by wounding their beſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, forced him to turne and execute his wrath upon his own company.</p>

               <p>Whiles theſe were bandying for glory in the field of Mars, <hi>Tzed-cawn</hi> and <hi>T'zed-Iacup</hi> give a brave charge upon <hi>Tzalibeg</hi> and <hi>Amet-cawn;</hi> where after mutuall giving and receiving blowes <hi>Tzalibeg</hi> deſcends firſt a degree of miſery by being unhorſt by his adverſaries Elephant, and by <hi>Tzed-cawn</hi> forc't to a deadly dormitorie. <hi>Amet-cawn</hi> (alſo adventring further than diſcretion warranted) is taken by <hi>Radjea Doola</hi> and beheaded: ſo is <hi>Tzalibeg,</hi> and both, ſent to <hi>Saffinchan</hi> as a reall trophy and teſtimoniall of their victory.

                  <hi>Mahobet-chan</hi> (like all other motions, when at higheſt, deſcend) quickly knowes of <hi>Iangheers</hi> flight, and is not ſo grieved at his being gone, as in the manner, intending never to withhold him longer than he fancied: yet the revolt of 5000 of his men did not a little trouble him: howbeit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his enemyes were approaching, and that it was no fit tyme to dwell upon circumſtances, he apparrells himſelfe in a rich and tryed coat of mayle, and with his ſhield and ſpeare ſpurs up in view of the Moguls <hi>Leſcar;</hi> where, by all ſignes he perceives the Mogulls affection eſtranged; he ſighes at it, and returnes, orders his army, and after a ſhort Oration goes on in front to begin the combat.

In it the holy Decalogue was given; in it was hatcht the deluſive Alcaron: if gums aromatick, ſucculent fruits, fragrant flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſuch like delicacies can captivate thee, ſay then, <hi>Arabia</hi> is the Phoenix of the Eaſt, with <hi>Danaeus</hi> the epitomè of delight, and with Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> that it is Paradize.</p>
               <p>'Tis tripartite; <hi>Deſerta, Petroſa;</hi> and <hi>Felix. Deſerta</hi> is alſo call'd <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis, profunda</hi> and <hi>aſpera;</hi> by <hi>Servius, Lucian</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides.

Let us view it as it was and is.</p>
               <p>The Altitude of the pole here, is 27 degrees: and though it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the torrid zone, yet what by the ſulphur of the earth, and oblique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex of the burning Sun, for foure moneths (from May to September) no place in the world is more hot or ſcalding; it is the cuſtome here to ſleep in beds of rayne water, which is not very coole neither, all day naked: the City had a faire Bazzar, many Churches, and Frieries, brave Magazeens, ſtately houſes, and as gallant a caſtle as any other in Orient; the caſtle is yet in good ſtrength and repayre; the reſt, levelled with the ground; of which I cannot ſay, <hi>Nunc ſeges ubi Troja fuit,</hi> the ſoile being uncapable of corne or other graine: at that end againſt <hi>Dozar</hi> (and the great <hi>Bannyan</hi> tree in the continent) the City was built; where the ſea is ſo narrow that a Cannon may eaſily ſpit over: the whole Ile exceeds not fifteene myles compaſſe: it is the moſt barren ground in the world, neither tree nor ſpring of good water could we find in it. It has ſalt, ſilver ſhining ſand, and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls of ſulphur; has nothing elſe worth the looking on: And yet from the advantagious ſtanding, the laborious Portugal made it the ſtaple and glory of the world; ſecured indeed by many naturall props, on all ſides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Iles and townes to furniſh her: <hi>Larac</hi> (<hi>Azgillia</hi> of old) <hi>Kiſhmy</hi> (by ſome cald <hi>Quexome</hi> or <hi>Broict</hi>) <hi>Keys</hi> or <hi>Queys</hi> Ile, <hi>Angen, Andreve</hi> (or <hi>de los paſharos</hi>) <hi>Kargh, Baharem</hi> (<hi>Icara</hi> in Pliny) <hi>Dozaro, Iaſques,</hi> and <hi>Koſtack</hi> in <hi>Margaſtan</hi> (now <hi>Mogeſtan</hi>) vicinating them. So as to the eye of man no place could be more offenſive and defenſive, garriſons of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galls ever lying in theſe Ilands; and yet, when the God of Nature had decreed a ruine, it could not be withſtood, but was in ſome regard mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly effected, and at ſuch a tyme as they leaſt ſuſpected it.</p>
               <p>But to doe her all the favour I can: let us remember ſuch Princes as have honourd her: <hi>Sha-Mahomet</hi> is the firſt I find, who in the 80 yeare of the <hi>Heg:</hi> Of Chriſt 700, left his ſeat at <hi>Aman</hi> in Arabia, and ſat downe at <hi>Calciat</hi> upon the ſhoare, but diſliking it, removed to <hi>Coſtac</hi> in <hi>Mogeſtan</hi> (ſix and twenty leagues from <hi>Iaſques</hi>) and there built a city which he cald <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and from whence part of Arabia took name; to him ſuccceded <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> to him <hi>Izachan,</hi> to who <hi>Mahobet</hi> 2, <hi>Shawran-ſhaw,</hi> (who bequeathed the crowne to his Nephew) <hi>Emer-ſha-bedin-Molong,</hi> whoſe daughter and heire married <hi>Seyfadin Aben-Ezer</hi> ſonne to <hi>Ally-ſhaw</hi> Lord of <hi>Keys</hi> Iland: the crown (they wanting iſſue) then came to <hi>Sha-Bedin Mahomet</hi> his

               <p>The particular Acts and paſſages in taking this famous Citie, is thus (for ſome mens better ſatisfaction) remembred.</p>
               <p>At command of <hi>Shaw Abbas</hi> the Perſian Monarch, <hi>Emangoly-chawn</hi> (chiefe Lord and Governour of thoſe Territories that conjoyne the gulph of <hi>Perſia</hi>) deſcends with nine thouſand men, at ſuch a time as he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to meet the Engliſh Fleet, reſolv'd to further them in revenge of thoſe many tyrannies they had endured by the braving Portugall: The Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions betwixt them, under hand and ſeale were theſe: 1. The Caſtle of <hi>Ormus</hi> (in caſe it were won) with all the Ordnance and Amunition to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Engliſh. 2. The Perſians were to build another Caſtle in the Ile at their owne coſt, when and where they pleaſed. 3. The ſpoile to be equally devided. 4. The Chriſtian priſoners to be diſpoſed of by the Engliſh; the Pagans by the Perſians. 5. The Perſians to allow for halfe the charges of victualls, wages, ſhott, powder, &amp;c. 6. And the Engliſh to be cuſtome free in <hi>Bander-gum-broon</hi> for ever. The Captaines of beſt note in the Pagan Army under the Duke of <hi>Shyraz,</hi> were <hi>Alliculybeg, Pollotbeg, Shakulibeg, Shareearee, Mahomet Sultan</hi> and <hi>Alybeg</hi> King of the Port: theſe with the reſt of their Army encamped before <hi>Bander-gom-broon:</hi> and two dayes after <hi>viz.</hi> the twentieth of Ianuary 1622. with ſmall difficulty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of the Port. Upon which the Duke and the Engliſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <hi>Weddall, Blyth,</hi> and <hi>Woodcock</hi> agreed upon an immediate battery, and inſtantly played upon the Caſtle with a dozen peeces of Cannon for five houres, but gave them ſmall hopes of ſudden conqueſt: yet that neither puſillanimity nor doubt might be ſeene amongſt them, the ninth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary the Engliſh tranſported three thouſand Perſians in two Frigots lately taken, and two hundred Perſian Boats good for little other ſervice: theſe, ſo ſoone as they were landed, having formerly made Sconces or

Trenches for their men, and Bulwarks for the great Ordnance to play on, very furiouſly they made towards <hi>Ormus</hi> thinking to meet no great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall; but the Portugalls though they let them land and paſſe quietly into the Towne, with equall reſolution ſtopt the current of their fury, at firſt encounter from their barracadoes defended with ſhott and pike, ſlaying above three hundred, and with their Ordnance beat them back with more haſte and amazedneſſe than their approach had courage: in this diſorder a Flancker by miſchance was blowne up, but the warre continued: little hurt accruing to either party, till the 24 of February, on which day the Engliſh advanced towards the Caſtle, (under which was riding the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Armado) and in deſpight of the Caſtle and beſt defence their Fleet could make, being then but five Gallyons and twenty Frigots, ſet fire on the Saint <hi>Pedro</hi> of one thouſand five hundred Tun, and Admirall of their Armado: which miſchance, the reſt of the Spaniſh Fleet with no ſmall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row apprehended, and finding no repaire, to prevent more miſchiefe and danger, cut the Cables, and in that flaming poſture let her drive whither winde and tyde commanded her: the Engliſh ſaw her too hot to meddle with, and knew ſhe could enrich the adventurer with no other booty, but <hi>Bellonaes</hi> furniture, ſo downe ſhe went towards <hi>Larack,</hi> in the way a rabble of Arabians and Perſians boorded her, &amp; like Iackhalls with hunger ſtarved fury and avarice tore her aſunder: that rapine, being no leſſe baſe and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious than the fire which two houres had aſſaulted her:<note place="margin">

This enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment ſo cool'd their bravery, that for five dayes they did nothing but contemplate the valour and dexterity of their adverſaries. But, the three and twentieth day aſſum'd more hopes, when they beheld the fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Engliſh and them; our Cannon from the ſhore, playing ſo hotly

and battring their fortifications ſo ſoundly, that at length making the ſhips their object (after a great mutilation of ſhrowds and maſts) they ſunk the Vice &amp; reare Admirall of <hi>Ru-Fryero's</hi> Fleet: by that, utterly loſing their late hopes and oſtentation of marine command and excellencie. March 28 neceſſity humble them (plague, famine, and fluxes raging in the City) ſo as five dayes after, two wel-bred Gentlemen, well attended, with great gravity mounted in a faire equipage to the Enemies Camp; they were uſherd in by ſome Coozelbaſhes of <hi>Shaculybegs</hi> Regiment, and after ſmall comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, begun to treat of peace, and that there might be a ceſſation of Armes, which favour if the Duke would grant, they were ready to acknowledge it, and for retribution to preſent him two hundred thouſand Tomayns in hand, with good aſſurance of an annuall tribute of 140000 Ryalls, (which as afterwards they confeſſed was ſpoken in hypocriſie) the Captaine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes them, and appoints next day for anſwer, acquaints the Generall, who (wanting money) accepts their motion of peace, ſo they would depoſe five hundred thouſand (amounting with us almoſt to two millions of pounds) and pay yeerely to the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> hundred thouſand: the Portugalls return'd him an anſwer, they were in no ſuch diſtreſſe, to buy any favour ſo diſhonourably, and that greedineſſe ſo overwhelmed them, they aſſured, a fift part of that proportion ſhould never buy their ableſt benefits. After that, they mediated a reconciliation twixt the Engliſh and them, putting them in minde, how they were Chriſtians, and by many reciprocall favours of old (when <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gant</hi> invaded them) and later times by allyances, prevalent enough to beget good will in noble ſpirits. If they had injured them, they were now ſorry, and ready to ſatisfie in any puniſhment of paine or purſe, their Kings were at that inſtant good friends, and how could ſuch hoſtility be defended or anſwerd by law of Nations or Religion. Theſe and the like were ſent them, but whether the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the <hi>Fidalgo</hi> diſpleaſed our Sea men, or that they underſtood them not, or ſaw themſelves ſo farre ingaged, that with reputation they could not deſiſt, or that it was uttered with a faigned humility, or the like, I know not; the Meſſenger departed not well ſatisfied. And two dayes after, ſaw apparently ſignes of confuſion and revenge: a hideous noiſe of helliſh thunder amazing them, caus'd by the Engliſh their blowing up two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Mynes, which gave open proſpect into the Citie; but the hearts of the aſſaylants durſt not travell with their ſight, all their ſenſes the laſt time were ſo confounded and diſabled: ſo that very poorely they onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſpectators, and gave new courage to the dying Portugall: all of them halfe dead, with fluxes, thirſt, (the three pits in the Citie exhauſted) fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or peſtilence. The fourteenth day, a ſhip full of Moores from <hi>Kiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee,</hi> arrived at <hi>Ormus</hi> to help the Portugalls; perceiving themſelves inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, they returned back, thinking to land at ſome better quarter: the Perſian Generall, ſwore they ſhould receive no dammage by his Army, to which when they fooliſhly gave beliefe to, fourſcore of their heads were forthwith ſtruck off, and the reſt inchayned.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ormuzians</hi> languiſhing thus long under ſo many ſorts of afflictions, every houre hoped for delivery from <hi>Ru-Friero,</hi> but he failed them. The ſeventeenth day another breach was made by giving fire to ſixty barrels of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20354:65"/>
powder, through which the Moores entred in huge ſwarmes, but were beat back by eighteene Gentlemen without the Bulwark; howbeit, next day they re-entred and poſſeſſed it. The eighteenth of Aprill, two famiſht renegadoes ſtole thence into the Camp of their Adverſaries, and being brought before the Duke, confeſt the willingneſſe of their departure, told him their expectation of ſupplies, together with their preſent miſeries; aſſuring him, they could not endure long, death raging more furiouſly within the City, than the greateſt forces they could oppoſe them with. At that report, the reanimated <hi>Perſian</hi> againe beſeiges her, intending the next breach to enter pellmell amongſt them: which when the <hi>Portugall</hi> ſaw, and no ſafety any way appearing; the three and twentieth day (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no faith in the Mahomitans) they yeelded the Caſtle, and their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto the Engliſh; only craving of them that they might receive their lives, and be conveyed ſafely to <hi>Muskat</hi> in <hi>Arabia:</hi> the Engliſh aſſent, and very nobly tranſported three thouſand of them, and entended like favour to the reſt; but the envious <hi>Perſian</hi> ſuddenly intercepted above three hundred <hi>Arabs</hi> halfe Chriſtians, and <hi>Portugals:</hi> whom without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley or any ſigne of pitty, contrarie to their oath and honour, they behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſent their heads to <hi>Gombroon</hi> for a Trophae, and as an aſſured ſignal of their conqueſt and blameworthy fury. After this, by unanime aſſent, the Magazeens of armour, victualls and treaſure were ſealed up with the ſignets of both Nations: the interim was imployed in maſſacring of more than halfe dead men, violating women, polluting Temples, and defacing verie brave and gallant houſes; during which, an unworthie Engliſh man (contrarie to the order) breaks into a forbidden Monaſterie ſtuft with riches, and in his returne is diſcried by the ratling of his burthenſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge; at which the Perſians flie to the Duke, and by conſent break aſunder everie thing was valuable, (the Engliſh all that time dreaming of no ſuch accident) bus when it was known, much diſcourſe intervened on both ſides, but the Pagans accounted words but ayre, and ſeeing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes accompliſhed, made the fury and anger of the Engliſh meere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocatives of ſcorne and laughter: the Enliſh had no more than twentie thouſand pounds paid them for their ſervice. The braſſe Ordnance in the Caſtle and Rampires were divided, ſome ſay they were three hundred, others as many moe: Howbeit, our men ſay there were only fifty three great braſſe peeces mounted, foure braſſe cannon, ſix braſſe demicannon, ſixteen cannon pedroes of braſſe, and one of iron, 9 culverin of braſſe, two demiculverin of braſſe, three of iron, ten braſſe baſes, ſeven braſſe baſtels, ſome baſilisks of 22 foot long, and nintie two braſſe peeces unmounted; which I the rather name, in that the Portugalls bragge they had ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and few Ordnance; with either of which if they had beene fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <hi>Ormus</hi> had never beene triumphed over. Thoſe belonging to the Perſian were tranſported to other Cittadells, to <hi>Gombroon, Larr, Shyraz, Hiſpahan,</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> The King of <hi>Ormus, Seid Mahumet ſhaw,</hi> was made priſoner to the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and at this day is at <hi>Shyraz</hi> under an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of five markes a day; his other penſion (during his proſperity paid him by the Portugalls) amounted yeerely to a hundred and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ryalls. The Town at this day is wholly ruinous, the Caſtle excepted,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20354:65"/>
which aſpect keepes her former beauty, ſtrength, and greatneſſe, and is owned by the Perſian.</p>
               <p>As for the common Mariners, they found enough to throw away; by that little they got, ſhewing their luxurie, nothing but <hi>Alea, vina, Venus,</hi> in the aſcendant of their devotion. Captain <hi>Woodcocks</hi> luck was beſt and worſt; by rare chance he lighted upon a Frigot that was ſtealing away, loden with Pearles and ineſtimable treaſure, above a Million of royalls for his part only; but what joy had he in that fading pelfe? pure clay is gold, who then ſo mad to make the earth his Idol? Whether poore (too rich) <hi>Woodcock</hi> minded more his tempting Mammon than the ſtearage of his ſhip, who can tell? but many felt by ſad experience that the Whale his ſhip ſunck cloſe by Swally barre, the name neither of bird nor fiſh availing againſt the arrow of death, the mercileſſe elements yeelding them no comfort: ſuch cataſtrophes have ambition and too much greedineſſe. For, but for too much pride (the Portugall upon all occaſions braving the Engliſh) <hi>Ormus</hi> had ſtood; and but for too much avarice, who knows but the Whale might have ſwam ſtill in the Ocean of ſecurity.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE tenth of Ianuary, Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> at our Ambaſſadors requeſt, entred <hi>Gumbrown</hi> to acquaint the Sultan with his arrivall, and to demand ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment and neceſſaries as befitted his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Travaile to the Perſian Court, though no leſſe diſtant than the Caſpian ſea. It did not reliſh right to the covetous Sultan; but upon ſight of his Phirman or letter of Command, he diſſembled his humour, proteſting he was tranſported with joy that ſo happy an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was hapned, as well to expreſſe himſelfe an obedient ſlave to <hi>Shaw-Abbas,</hi> as that the Towne ſhould be honoured by ſo noble a ſtranger; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry onely he was ſo ill fitted to ſhew his humanity, his Lordſhips ſo ſudden landing preventing the pomp he aymed him. Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> returned his complement and forthwith invited my Lord Ambaſſador aſhoare, who as readily accepted it. At his iſſuing from the ſhip, Captaine <hi>Browne</hi> (whom I name to honour him) thundred out his farewell by a hundred great Shot, whoſe Ecchoes not onely made <hi>Gombroon</hi> to tremble, but ſeemed to rend the higher regions with their bellowings. Wrapt in ſmoak and flame, we landed ſafely, tho Neptune made us dance upon his liquid billowes and with his ſalt breath ſeaſoned the Epicinia or intended Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs. At his landing the Cannons from the Caſtle and Cittadell vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out their fiery choller, ten tymes roring out their wrathfull clamours, to our delight and terrour of the Pagans, who of all noyſes moſt hate artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Thunder. The Sultan and <hi>Shawbander</hi> handed him out of his Bardge, and mounted him upon a ſtately Arabian Courſer; the ſtirrops were of pure gold, the ſaddle (a Morocco ſort) was moſt richly imbrodered with ſilver. All his followers had alſo ſuch as pleaſed them. In this equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, attended by his owne gentlemen, ſome ſea Captaines, the Engliſh Agent Maſter <hi>Burt</hi> and two hundred <hi>Coozell-baſhawes,</hi> we moved ſlowly towards the Sultans Pallace, all the way paſſing through a ranck, or file of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20354:66"/>
Archers and Muſquetiers on either ſide doubled, and being alighted, uſherd him into his Apollo; where upon rich carpets was plac't a neat and coſtly Banquet, ſtore of <hi>Shyraz</hi> Wine, and choyce Violls from the ſhips; all which, with his proteſtations of welcome, (<hi>Hoſhomody Suffowardy</hi> ſtill dropping out of his mouth) gave us undoubted knowledge that either he was a grand hypocrite, or extreamely fearefull a complaint ſhould be made to the great Duke of <hi>Shyraz</hi> againſt him of his paſt neglect; all which we gave a favourable interpretation unto: let us now into and about the towne, to ſee if ought will preſent it ſelfe a welcome object.</p>

               </gap> cald <hi>Bander</hi> or the Port Towne: ſeated upon the gulph, in the <hi>Carmanian</hi> deſert (part whereof is now cald <hi>Larr</hi>) or in <hi>Kermoen</hi> as the Perſians call it; albeit my fancie prompts me, that it is rather in <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtan, Shuſhan</hi> being ſo ſmall a way removed from it. Some (but I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them not) write it <hi>Gamrou,</hi> others <hi>Gomrow,</hi> and other-ſome <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meroon.</hi> The Artique pole mounts here to ſeven and twenty degrees and nine minutes. A Towne it is of no Antiquity, riſing daily out of the ruines of late glorious (now moſt wretched) <hi>Ormus,</hi> an houres journey thence.</p>
            <p>I was told, that it had not twelve houſes twelfve yeares ago; at this day encreaſed to a thouſand: but how can I credit it, ſince one <hi>Newbery</hi> our country-man entitles it a Town at his being here, which was in the yeare 1581. Yet old it cannot be, ſince all agree the Portugals firſt founded it; after <hi>Ormous</hi> doubtleſſe, and where the Caſtle was begun but in <hi>Anno</hi> 1513 by <hi>Albuquerq'</hi> the Portugall. <hi>Gumbroon</hi> is from <hi>Ormus</hi> nine engliſh myles: it alſo viewes Arabia about ſixteene leagues weſt, for there the Gulph is narroweſt. It was forced from the Portugall in the yeare 1612 by <hi>Ally-Reec</hi> the <hi>Shyrazian,</hi> and is now compleatly governed by the Perſian. It is in compaſſe about two myles, the earth is ſandy, without gardens, ſprings, or graſſe: from March to October ſo hot, as the Natives flie away to <hi>Larr</hi> and other Townes where Date trees ſhadow them againſt the ever burning Sunne, and ground or ſand that ſcalds like hotteſt embers: a great Mountayne (reckned twenty miles diſtant, but by its height ſeemes not eight) anticipates the coole North-wind, which to other parts breaths ſweetly and refreſhes them. The houſes are of Sunne-dried bricks, thick &amp; ſollid; within, are without much furniture; without ſimple to look upon. The windowes are large and trelliſed, made to open when any Favonius murmurs among them. The tops are tarraſſed, made both to walk &amp; ſleep upon, ſo Carpets be ſpred to ſoften them. In the Summer ſeaſon when few ſhips ride here, they ſleep in troughs or beds fild with water. The Buzzar is very ordinary: tis covered atop to keep out the ſearching beames of the ſcortching Sunne; where under is ſold Wine, Arack, Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, Thlummery, and many other things to the eye and belly neceſſary. The entrance into the Sultans houſe, is at the Eaſt ſide of the Market place. His, the Shabanders, Engliſh, and Duch (diſtinguiſht by their Flags or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, displayed by <hi>Aeolus</hi> atop their houſes) are all are worth the entring in or my noting: of beſt note, are two Caſtles, at the North and South ends of the Towne, ſpatious and defenſive; adorn'd with good Battlements and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20354:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Platformes to play their uſeleſſe Cannons on. Foureſcore braſſe Peeces are planted here, and are part of thoſe they got from <hi>Ormus Anno</hi> 1622; two hundred more being ſent up to <hi>Larr, Spahawn</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>) of ſmall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, if no better Gunners exerciſe them. Whiles ſhips ride here, <hi>Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broon</hi> is a garriſon foure hundred horſe and foot attend their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; but dare not fight againſt the Sonne, all ſummer billeting where they can find food and ſhelter. In winter you may find here, Merchants of ſundry Nations; Engliſh, Ducth, Perſians, Indians, Arabs, Armenians, Turks, Iewes, and others. The moſt common commodities here, are belly food; Wine, Rack, Sherbet, Roſewater, Sugar, Almonds, Dates, Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, Figs, Currans, Orenges, Lemmons, Pomecitrons, Mirabolans, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Peares, Quinces, and Flowers, in great variety. As alſo, Goates, Hens, egges (two yeare old,) Ryce, &amp;c. moſt of which are ſold by the crafty, faire ſpoken <hi>Bannyans,</hi> who ſwarme through all parts of Aſia. They will readily trade or prattle with Chriſtian, Turk, Iew, or Gentile, but have no good fellowſhip, for they hate to eat or drink with any ſave of their owne caſts and religion; rice, plaintains, and ſome fruits they eat, drink water or ſherbet (which is faire water, roſewater, ſugar and juyce of Lemons put together): but for fleſh, eggs, or ſuch roots, as raddiſh and the like, reſembling blood or wine, not one bitt would they eat, though you would give the pooreſt knave amongſt them, a thouſand pound; they are troubled with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> dreames, doubting thereby they might eat up the ſoules of their friends or parents; which tranſmigration of ſoules <hi>Tibullus</hi> elegantly thus detects to his Miſtreſſe.</p>

            <p>Some Sudatories (cald here Hummums,) ſome Moſques, ſome Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and Sanhedrins are here; but thoſe ſo obſcure, that the eye can ſcarce direct us to them. Moſt remarkable is the great <hi>Banayan</hi> Tree, a league Eaſt from the Towne, and oppoſite to <hi>Ormus</hi> Caſtle: a Tree (or rather twenty Trees, the boughs rooting and ſpringing up a whole aker together rounded within and ſhaded in forme of a Theater, two hundred and nine paces about as I meaſured and wherein, or under, may ambuſh very ſecretly three hundred horſe: ſome call it the arched Fig tree, ſome <hi>Arbor de Rays,</hi> (a tree of Roots) others <hi>de Goa:</hi> namd by us the <hi>Bannyan</hi> Tree, from their adorning and adoring it with ribbons and ſtreamers of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricoloured Taffata, a goodly Diety! ſuch a one as <hi>Pliny</hi> obſervd long ſince in his Travayles amongſt 'em. <hi>Haec fuere Numinûm Templa, priſcoque ritu, etiam nunc ſimplicia rura Deo praecellentem Arborem dicant.</hi> Here under

alſo, they have a temple, ſupported on one ſide by the body of the tree, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen to ſuch as are without the branches; in which (for I adventured in) are three of the moſt deformed Pagods or Idols imaginable; invocated by the Bannyan in memoriall of <hi>Cuttery, shuddery,</hi> and <hi>Wyſe,</hi> their three dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied predeceſſors; kept by an old doting Braminy, who for above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeeres in this irreligious place has moſt wickedly ſacrifizd his ſoule to <hi>Belzebub;</hi> for many yeeres hee had all the Pagods offerings, part being the virginity of the Brides (at ten yeeres commonly) which ſince he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actuate, he is not aſham'd (as I was told) to contract with Travellers, who in an infernall diſguiſe reap the unripe and unholy Holocauſts.</p>

            <p>To concomitate thoſe carrion women, take notice of thoſe troopes of Jackalls, which here more than any other where rally themſelves, not only each night committing burglary in the Town, but commonly they teare the dead out of their graves, and with a vulture appetite devoure their carcaſſes; all the while ululating and in offenſive noiſes barking and ecchoing out their ſacriledge. Wee made good ſport to hunt them with doggs and ſwords, but they are too many to be baniſht, too unruly to be conquered. I take them for thoſe the Romans call'd <hi>Crocutae,</hi> the Greeks <hi>Alopecidae,</hi> or <hi>Lyciſcae</hi> (<hi>Multum latrante Lyciſca</hi>) and are either an unnaturall mixture of a Bitch and Fox, or doggs from <hi>Europe;</hi> by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ayre and ſoile varying in <hi>ſpecie</hi> from what they were formerly; obſerv'd in other things; the Indian Ounces, what be they but extract from Cats of <hi>Europe?</hi> Spaniſh doggs, in new <hi>Spaine,</hi> in the ſecond litter doe they not become Wolves? good Melons being alſo tranſplanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a baſe and barren ground, turne quickly to ordinary Cowcumbers.</p>
            <p>Fourteene dayes are paſt ſince we entred <hi>Gombroon;</hi> the place has no ſuch Magick to perſwade us to inhabit here. Our end is travell, why ſtay we then? ſure, wee were ſtayed three dayes by the Sultans ſuperſtition, who upon caſting the Dice, if the chance prov'd right, would let us goe; if wrong, <hi>nigro carbone notatus.</hi> The foure and twentieth day the Die was right, and wee were mounted; our little Carravan conſiſted of twelve horſe and 29 Camells: the Engliſh Agent and other of our owne, and ſome Dutch Merchants attended our Ambaſſadour a league out of the Towne; where, the Sultan met us, who (well pleas'd with the Piſcaſh or Preſent our Ambaſſador had given him) payed us all a hundred <hi>Sallams</hi> and <hi>Teſſelams:</hi> that is, God ſpeed you well, God keepe you. And lifting up his eyes to heaven, his hands to his breaſt, and bending almoſt unto his ſtirrop, once more bad farewell &amp; ſo returned. His men &amp; he all the way back played at <hi>Giochi di Canni,</hi> darting at one another very dexterouſly. Wee heard the King was ſolacing at the Caſpian Sea, whither now wee are travelling. Till then let us keepe an <hi>Ephemerides</hi> or day-journey. The firſt night (from <hi>Gumbroon</hi>) wee rode to <hi>Bandally,</hi> ſixteene Engliſh miles (and moſt part along the gulph) or to compute it in the Perſian tongue, five farſangs and a halfe; a farſang (<hi>Pliny</hi> calls it a <hi>paraſang</hi> which containes thirty ſtades or foure Italian miles) is three of ours, or a Dutch league; in names only different. At <hi>Band Ally</hi> we found a neat <hi>Carravans-raw</hi> or <hi>Inne,</hi> the Turks call them <hi>Imareths,</hi> the Indians <hi>Sarrays;</hi> built by mens charity, to give all civill paſſengers a reſting place <hi>gratis;</hi> to keepe them from the injury of theeves, beaſts, weather, &amp;c: for, through all <hi>Aſia</hi> we find no other receptories, nor proviſion ſave what we carry along,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20354:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>

Next night wee got to <hi>Gacheen,</hi> five farſangs further; the third night to <hi>Cowreſtan,</hi> ſeven; next, to <hi>Tanghy-Dolon</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> a narrow way) praiſe-worthy in her Lodge or Carravans-raw, but eſpecially in the ſweet Cryſtallin water wee found there. It iſſues from a mighty mountain three mileſ Eaſt thence, and in an <hi>Aquae-duct</hi> ſports wantonly to this Tanck, whoſe over plus is received (by another Pipe laid in an artificiall way cut mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly through the bottome of an adjoyning rockie hill) into a large Pond; which, richly mellowes all the Vally (reſembling <hi>Tempe</hi>) and Town call'd <hi>Dolon,</hi> ſurrounded with ſtudpendious hills on every ſide, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, as with few men may bee made impregnable; a ſolitary place it is, but exceeding pleaſant; when from the hill tops wee dazell our ſights in view of that ſandy, ſtony, ſterill Deſert. That dayes journey was foure farſangs.</p>
            <p>Our next daies travell was to <hi>Whormoot,</hi> eleven farſangs (thirty three miles) where we found a black pavillion; in it three old Arabians; who, out of their Alcoran ingeminated a dolefull requiem to their Brothers carcaſſe, over which they ſat; their lookes were clouded with pathetick ſadneſſe; their cheekes bedewed with briny teares, intending (after the Jewiſh mode, <hi>Septem ad luctum</hi>) to ſolemniſe his farewell ſeven daies, ſinging, ſighing, weeping.</p>

Wee had not rode halfe a mile further, when, loe an antick Perſian out of a Poetick rapture, clamored out a ſong of welcome: the Epilog was reſounded upon kettle Drums, Timbrells, and Barbarrous Jingle-jangling inſtruments; a homely <hi>Venus</hi> attired like a <hi>Bacchanell,</hi> attended by many other moriſdancers, begun to caper and frisk their beſt lavoltoes; every limb ſtrove to exceed each other, the Bells, braſſe Cimbals, kettle muſick and whiſtles, ſtorming ſuch a Phrygick diſcord, that to conſort we might ſqueak'out.</p>

            <p>LARR, is a City and Province in <hi>Perſia;</hi> on the North limited with <hi>Parc</hi> or <hi>Pharſiſtan;</hi> on the Eaſt with <hi>Carmoan</hi> or <hi>Carmania;</hi> has the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian gulph to the South; and to the Weſt, <hi>Chuſiſtan</hi> or <hi>Suſiana;</hi> a region a thouſand miles in circuit: barren and flaming hot, full of ſand, ſtones, a few Date trees, Mines, and ſulphur.</p>

            <p>Nine dayes we ſtaid in <hi>Larr;</hi> a ſhame it were, if in ſo long time we had noted nothing. <hi>Lar</hi> is from <hi>Gumbroon</hi> ſeven ſmall dayes riding; from <hi>Shyraz</hi> foureteene, from <hi>Babylon</hi> twenty: a very poore Towne it is, as being parcht with the ſcalding Sun, defaced by rage of warre, and thrown down by many fearfull Earth-quakes. <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1400, it ſhook ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly, and made five hundred houſes proſtrate to its Tiranny. <hi>Anno</hi> 1593. of their account 973. ſhe boaſted of five thouſand houſes; but ſee how vain: is the pride of man: that very yeere, the earth ſweld with ſuch a dreadfull tympany, that in venting it ſelfe, it made all <hi>Larr</hi> to quake; and in fine, would not be ſuppreſt, but by the weight of three thouſand houſes turned topſi-turvie, quaſhing to death three thouſand men in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The old Caſtle alſo on the Eaſt ſide of the Towne (it owes its foundation to <hi>Georgean Melec</hi>) though built atop a ſolid rock, groand in a like affrighting downfall: and to me it ſeemed ſtrange, a City ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo ſurely founded, ſhould be ſo ſubject to ſuch unnaturall commotions. Whither it be (as <hi>Democritus</hi> dreamt) from the gaping Sun-torne earth quaffing in too greedily too much water, and (like a glutted drunkard)
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20354:69"/>
overcharging her caverns, vomits it up in a forcible and diſcontented mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or whether (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches) from vapors ingendred in the bowels of the earth, and loth to bee impriſoned in a wrong orb, rends its paſſage by a viperous horrid motion: or whether from ſubterranean fires, the ayre inflamed upon ſulphur, or ſuch exuberances of nature, I dare not conclude, but leave ſuch theories to thoſe that ſtudy Meteors. Let us therefore ſee what <hi>Larr</hi> now is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Larr,</hi> the Metropolis of this Province, is not wald about; in that, Art is needleſſe, the lofty rocks on Eaſt and North ſo naturally defend her: beſides, a brave Caſtle at the North quarter (mounted upon an imperious hill) not only threatens an enemy, but awes the Towne in a frownig poſture: the aſcent is narrow and ſteep: the Caſtle of good ſtone: the walls are furniſht with uſefull battlements: whereon are mounted twelve braſſe cannon pedroes, and two baſilisks (the ſpoiles of <hi>Ormus:</hi>) within the Caſtle wall are raiſd a hundred houſes, ſtored with men, moſt part ſoldatts, who have there a gallant Armory able to furniſh with Lance, Bow, and Gun, three thouſand men: it is a fort without, of a ſtately frame: within, is no leſſe commendable: the <hi>Buzzar</hi> is alſo a gallant fabrick; the materiall is good chalkie ſtone; long, ſtrong, and beautifull: a quadrant I cannot call it, the ſides are ſo unequall: tis cover'd atop, archt, and (in piazza ſort) a kinde of Burſe; wherein each ſhop ſhowes ware of ſeverall qualities: the Alley from North to South, is 170 of my paces; from Eaſt to Weſt, a hundred and ſixty; the ovall in center is about a hundred and ninty: a building (to ſpeak of the Aſiaticks) in ſome hundreds of miles, ſcarce to be parrelled. Neere this <hi>Buzzar</hi> are coyned the Larrees, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſort of money, ſhap'd like a long Date ſtone, the Kings name ſtampt upon pure ſilver, in our money valuing ten pence.</p>
            <p>The Moſques here bee not many; one eſpeciall Moſque (or Deer) it has, round (either ſhadowing out Aeternity, or from a patterne of the <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> the holy Temple in Mecca, whoſe ſhape they ſay <hi>Abraham</hi> had from heaven) in ſome part varniſht with Arabick letters, and painted knots, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht in other parts with Moſaick fancies: tis low, and without glaſſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, wodden trellizes (excellently cut after their invention) ſupplying them: the entrance is through a brazen gate, neer which is hung a Mirrour whether to admire their tallow faces in, or internal deformities, I know not: ſome lamps it alſo has, for uſe and ornament: ſome Prophets reſt their bones here, take one for all. <hi>Emeer-Ally-zedday-ameer,</hi> a long-namd-long-bon'd (if his grave bee right) long ſince rotten Prophet; the older Prophet, the freſher profit; zeale and charity oft times worſhip antiquity: but how can I credit them that he was a Mahometan; they ſay (if that will not pleaſe, they ſweare) hee died a thouſand five hundred yeeres ago, ſix hundred yeeres before <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and yet a Muſſulman: their faith admits no queſtions nor anſwers, or if it did, wee will not trouble it: For I ſee variety of good fruit cloſe by, to which I have a better appetite; here are the faireſt Dates (Dactills in Latin from their finger like ſhape) Orenges, Lemons, &amp; Pomcitrons you find in <hi>Perſia;</hi> if thoſe will not pleaſe, you buy here at eaſie rates, Goats, Hens, Rice, Rach, and Aquavitae: but for their water (wee dreſt our meat with it, the people drink it) they call it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20354:70"/>
Ob-baroon which in the language of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſignifies rain-water: but with farre more reaſon I may call it <hi>Aqua-Mortis;</hi> death ſeeming to bubble in it. A baſe qualified water it is; whether that their Tancks or Magazeens are ill made, or naſtily kept, and by that the water is corrupted; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the raine of it ſelfe is inſalubrious and loathſome I cannot tell; but both it may bee makes it ſo bad as it is; ſo unſapory, ſo ill to the guſt, as worſe water for taſte, and eſpecially for property can ſcarce be reliſhed: as little of it came in my belly as could be borrowed from extremity of thirſt; and I ſuppoſe I had good reaſon to forbeare it: for, it cauſes Catarrhs, breeds ſore eyes, ulcerates the guts, and which is more terrible than the raeſt, it ingenders ſmall long worms in the legges of ſuch as uſe to drink it; and, which ſort of vermin is not more loathſome to look upon, than painfull to the itching diſeaſe of them that breed 'em; by no potion, no unguent, to bee remedied: they have no other way to deſtroy them, ſave by rowling them about a pin or peg, not unlike the treble of a Theorbo; the moſt danger being this, that if in the ſcrewing the worme chance to break, it makes them very dolefull Muſick, for it endangers the leg, apt to gangreen and (but by lancing) hardly curable. The water is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe of this ſtrange malady: and ſeemes to mee to bring the venome from the region where tis generated; for, commonly the clouds here at <hi>Larr</hi> are undigeſted (as in the Tornadoes I have formerly ſpoken of) and unagitated by the wind; Nor do the clouds diſtill their raine in drops as is uſuall in colder regions, but in whole and violent irruptions; dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous both in the fall, and no leſſe hurtfull in the uſing.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants are moſt part naked and merit as naked a relation: they are a mixture of Jewes and Mahomitans: both of them, a ſwarthy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed generation: for generally in this City they are blear-eyd, rotten tooth'd, and mangy legd: the violent heat and poyſonous waters cauſes it: the habit of the greater part of them is only a wreath of Callico tyed about their heads; their mid-parts are circled with a Zone of vari-colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red plad, and have Sandalls upon their feet, elſewhere being naked: ſome indeed have ſhaſhes of ſilke and gold, tulipanted about their heads; they roab themſelves in coats or Cabays of Satten, and eſpecially inrich their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with rings of ſilver ſet with Turqueiſes or Cornelians, and in which they affect to have ingraven their owne name, or ſome ſelected poſie out of the Alcoran: upon their thumb they commonly weare a ring of horne which makes the arrowes go off ſtrong and eaſily: their crooked ſwords alſo afford them no ſmall delight, the blades being exceeding good, the hilts no leſſe valuable; for they are of gold: In this City ſhould bee a river and that not a ſmall one, if our Geographick Maps were true; but they erre egregiouſly, for here not only is no river, but alſo none elſe is to bee found in a hundred miles travell, go which way you will: for both by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of many Perſians &amp; our own experience in further travell, I could neither heare of nor ſee any neerer us than <hi>Tabb,</hi> famous in her ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating <hi>Suſiana</hi> from <hi>Carmania;</hi> and from <hi>Larr,</hi> weſtward about 5 ſmall daies journey hence: or that other of <hi>Cyre,</hi> over which we rode twixt <hi>Shyraz</hi> and old <hi>Perſepolis:</hi> ſome ſmall brooks wee rode over; but rivers no man muſt dare to call them, ſince none of them in bredth or depth exceed 3 foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:20354:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>Weſt of <hi>Larr</hi> is <hi>Iaarown,</hi> twenty farſangs (or threeſcorce Engliſh miles) thence: it is a Town conſiſting of a thouſand Jewiſh families: ſome make it their rode to <hi>Shyraz,</hi> but the way is extreame ſtony and mountainous, bad for horſemen, worſe for ill-ſhod Camells. Theſe Jewes (or Jehuds as the Perſians call them) are a remnant of thoſe foure Tribes, <hi>Salmanaſſar</hi> ſon to <hi>Tyglath Pilezer</hi> the Aſſyrian King forc't from <hi>Samaria Anno Mundi</hi> 3220. placing them in <hi>Hala, Hara</hi> and <hi>Ghabor</hi> (by the river <hi>Gozan</hi>) Cities of the Medes: the Towne (I do but imagine ſo) is named from <hi>Iaarim</hi> a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Towne in <hi>Canaan:</hi> they have ſome Sinagogues, but no high Prieſts; the Moſaicall Law they have wonderfully corrupted: they are to this day a hardharted ſubtle people; very cowardly, rich, but odious to all other religions: moſt remarkable, is a precious liquor or Mummy growing here, Mumnaky-koobas they call it, a liquor which none dare take, for all is carefully lookt to for the King. It diſtills (in June only) from the top of thoſe ſtupendious Mountaines, every yeere about five ounces: a moiſt redolent gumme it is, ſoveraign againſt all ſorts of poyſon; and (if we may beleeve them) a Catholicon for all wounds and moſt diſeaſes: when other Princes ſend this King preſents of gold, pearle, or other coſtly devices; he ſends them back, a little of this Balſome, as a full remuneration. Theſe Mountaines are famoſed in ſtory; After <hi>Alexander</hi> had preyed and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed in <hi>Suſa</hi> (betrayd by <hi>Abulites</hi> a time-ſerving Satrapa) he led his wanton Army towards <hi>Perſepolis;</hi> his neereſt paſſage was over theſe hills of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arown</hi> (in thoſe dayes cald <hi>Pilae Perſidis</hi> and <hi>Suſaidae</hi>) where to his amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was ſo beaten by <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> a Martialiſt and his ſmall company, that (contrary to the pace and honour of the worlds Monarch) he was conſtrain'd to retreat apace, and ſhamefully to avoyd that thundering ſtorme of ſtones and arrowes.</p>
            <p>The eleventh of February we left <hi>Larr, Codges-Obdruzy</hi> the Governor furniſhed us (to <hi>Shyraz</hi>) with Mules, very poore ones; the Aſſes they return'd upon: no matter. Mules are Emblems of ſobriety; our Harbinger (or Mammandore in Perſian) was an honeſt Cozelbaſh, and would be ſure, (hopefull of ſome reward, and becauſe his part lay therein) at every place where we made our Manzeel or reſt, to provide us good lodging, and ſuch meat as the country would affoord us: by vertue of his authority do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering over the wretched Ruſticks more than pleaſed us; he would proffer them a little mony for what he liked; if they refuſed to take it, he took it then by force, and Alla Soldado payd them in big words and baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes: in miſerable ſlavery the peſants live; a ſoldiers life is here the moſt honourable and ſafeſt. The firſt night we pitcht our Tents not far from <hi>Larr,</hi> but were ſtopt next day by an immoderate flood of raine, that made the earth ſo ſlippery, as our Cammells glib-hoofes could not foot it; the raine falls ſeldome here, but when it comes, they both feele and heare it: ſome times it raiſes ſuch a Deluge as ſweeps men and houſes away; ſix yeeres ago (in this place) a Caravan of two thouſand Camels periſht by the fury of it. The foureteenth day wee rode to <hi>Deachow</hi> (or <hi>Techoo</hi>) which ſignifies a Towne under a hill; where we ſee many prettie Tombs, not any without his grave-ſtone and an Arabick memoriall. The Alcoran commands that none be buried in Cities, for feare the noyſome Carcaſſes

infect the living, but in a Gemitery nigh the moſt publique highway; that by viewing the Sepulchers of the dead (the Romans did the like, the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians had them in their banquetting houſes) they might contemplate their mortality. A mile from this Towne we view'd threeſcore black Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villions; black without; within full of female beauties: the Perſians call them Vloches; the Arabs, Kabilai; the Turq'ſtans and Armenians, Taiphae; the Tartars, Hoords; the Antients, Nomades; of whom the Poet thus:

is a Deer or Moſquit, a venerable place, chiefly by being a Dormitory to their greateſt Doctor <hi>Emawm-zeddey-a meer-a maddy-Ally,</hi> a Prophets ſonne, and allyed to holy <hi>Ally;</hi> in this grave enjoying (ſay they) eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres reſt; a great antiquity. His Tomb is rais'd foure foot from the pavement, is eight foot long, covered with a white fine linnen cloth; the Tomb-ſtones are carved and painted with knots and poeſies of Arabick; neere him are fixt two Lances to memorize his quondam profeſſion, and ſome Enſignes not of ordinarie invention: Vpon his Coffin lie a ſet of goodly Beads, to help his devout memorie, and which to this day retaine their Maſters vertue of working miracles. Atop the Chappell is a globe (or ſteele mirrour) pendant, wherein theſe Linx-eyed people view the deformity of their ſinnes. They alſo ſhewed us a ſquare ſtone pearced and hung neere the wall, a rare ſtone, a relique moſt notorious! the Prophet uſed to burthen the backs of impenitent ſinners with it, telling them their impiety made it ſeeme heavie, a waight ſo ponderous as made them take the right path to be quit of it. A little pot comes next to our deſcription, holding a ſoveraigne unguent made eight hundred yeeres ſince, oft us'd, and never exhauſted: and is not only good to help ſore eyes, but a <hi>Panacea</hi> againſt all diſeaſes; to crowne all, his booke (no Alfurcan of devotion) is layd upon his carcaſſe; any body is ſuffered to ſee it a far off, but to touch it is counted a preſumption, the impure breath of man peradventure infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it: in ſtormes and croſſes they finde remedy with only naming it: the Church is neatly matted, a Moſque of ſo much holineſſe, that none muſt enter with boots or ſhooes on: ſuch as want iſſues (I meane not in their leggs) health, wealth, friends, or the like, upon their offring ſhall have ſatisfaction. The Oracle (the Prieſt) never cheats them. <hi>Sed non ego credulus illis:</hi> and with that I bid <hi>Berry</hi> farewell.</p>
            <p>Next night wee got to <hi>Bannarow.</hi> The laſt Towne feaſted us with Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, this with good cheare, muſick, three kettle drummes, and ſix dumb Muſquets. The ruines of an ancient Caſtle (demoliſht lately by the Perſian) ſhewes its ribs, through which the coole ayre blowes, ſeldome failing from the top of that ſtupendious Mountaine: one ſide of the Caſtle wall is anatomized to the Town, the other to the ſtony Deſart. Next night we lay in <hi>Goyeme,</hi> bragging in a thouſand rotten houſes. After we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd an houre, a Hocus-pocus affronted us, and performed rare tricks of Activity. I remember ſome of them. He trod upon two ſlicing hooked Semiters with his bare feet, then layd his naked back upon them, ſuffering a heavie Anvill to be layd on his belly, and two men to hammer out foure horſhooes on it very forceably. That trick ended, he thruſt his armes and thighes thorow with many Arrowes and Lances; then, by meere ſtrength of his block-head he lift up a yard from the ground a great ſtone, weighing ſix hundred pound, and (as if hee had done nothing) knit his haire to an old Goats head, and with a ſcornfull pull tore it aſunder, at that crying out <hi>Allough-whoddaw i.e.</hi> God help him; the ſtanders by with a loud yell, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded him: we gave him particular thanks, and told him he was a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fellow. But what was hee? to ſpeake of <hi>Marius</hi> (one of the thirty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants) who with one of his fingers could overthrow a loaded Wayne: or of <hi>Polydamas,</hi> who with one hand would hold a wild Bull by his hinder

legg, and in deſpight of his beſt force ſtop him, as <hi>Cael. Rhod.</hi> and <hi>Treb. Pollio</hi> have it. But in remembring theſe, I had almoſt forgot to tell you, that in <hi>Goyeom,</hi> is fairely intombed one <hi>Melec Mahomet,</hi> famous for fomenting the authority of his Maſter <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when the Saracens begun to canvaſſe it.</p>
            <p>Next night we loſt one another by a careleſſe aſſociating, and had a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable lodging in that vaſt and barren wilderneſſe: affording no graſſe, no trees, no water, but ſtones and ſand in great abundance, Oſtriches, Storks, and Pellicans her ſole Inhabitants. I beleeve the earth has worne <hi>Flora's</hi> livery; but, by the parching rage of Warre, or continued heat of the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sunne becomes thus miſerably deſart, or rather from the juſt wrath of Almighty God, <hi>who</hi> (as King <hi>David</hi> ſings) <hi>makes a fruitfull land barren, for the ungodlineſſe of them that dwell therein.</hi> Next day wee queſted in ſearch of our Carravan, and with much trouble recovered it: that night alſo pitching in the Deſart, were welcom'd by ſuch a ſudden ſtorm of rain, thunder, and lightning, as made our cheare more wretched, impriſoning us alſo in our Tents. Next day, wee had the weather comfortable, the ſight of a few Date and Maſtick tree, refreſhing us; confuting <hi>Coriats</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that Maſtick is found no where but in <hi>Syo.</hi> By the way we tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of an od-devis'd Tomb (it inhum'd a harmleſſe Shepheard) hung to and fro with threds tripartite (it may be, ſhadowing out the Trinity) each thred beautified with party-coloured wooll, at each end a Puppet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it, ſome Cypreſſes were added to condecorate and to revive the old Idoll ceremony.</p>

In a word (perceiving our haſte) he humby beſeecht his Lordſhip to practize but three dayes patience, till the great Duke might honour his entrance, and diſplay his radiance; a favour of a double reflex, in that it would infinitely content their Governour, and accumulate an incomparable ſplendor and triumph to his entrance, cloſing his hypocriſie with an if not, he was then preſt to uſher his Lordſhip to his lodging.

The Ambaſſador eaſily deſcryed him to be a <hi>Synon,</hi> ſent meerly to betray his credulity: ſo as perceiving no remedy, the twilight helping his ſilent paſſage (<hi>Apollo</hi> had already drencht his fiery tramels in maddame <hi>Thetis</hi> lapp, <hi>Cynthia</hi> alſo lookt pale, as diſpleaſd with ſo much knavery) we joggd leaſurely on upon our Portugall Trumpetters, who (ſo ſoone as they wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſmoak and ayre of this excellent Citty,) ſpared the Perſians a labour in their braſſe pans, hoboyes and ſuch Phrygick Muſique, ſometimes bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, at other tymes ecchoing to one another in their Mymallonian Cornets, as if ſome Orgies to <hi>Liber Pater</hi> had been ſolemnizing: in ſo much as many ran out of doores, others fired their flambeauxes to know the cauſe and glut their wonder.

            <p>It ſhewes ſome walls built by <hi>Vſan Caſſan,</hi> but ſeems to ſcorne a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bondage.

Defended by Nature, inricht by trade, by Art made lovely; the Vineyards, Gardens, Cypreſſes, Sudatories, and Temples, raviſh the eye and ſmell, in every part ſweet and delightfull.</p>
            <p>Here Art magick was firſt hatched. Here <hi>Nimrod</hi> (after <hi>Babells</hi> confuſion) lived and was buried. Here <hi>Cyrus</hi> (the moſt excellent of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Princes) was borne, and (all but his head) intombed. Here the great <hi>Macedonian</hi> glutted his Ambition and Bacchiſme.

other where is noted. Sultan <hi>Shock-Allybegs</hi> houſe (where the firſt night we were banqueted) is inferiour to few; his dining roome was high and round and ſpacious. The archt roofe and ſide walls imboſt with gold, and wrought into Imagery; ſo ſhadowed, that it was hard to judge whether imboſt, inſcult, or painted. The windowes were of painted glaſſe, the floore ſpred with curious Carpets. None are without their gardens, forreſts rather of high Chenaers and Cypreſſes.</p>
            <p>Fifteen Moſques profeſſe their bravery, round (after the holy <hi>Alkaba</hi> in <hi>Mecca</hi>) til'd without, and pargetted with azure ſtones reſembling Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoiſes; lined within, with pure black poliſht Marble; the tops dignified by many double guilded creſcents or ſpires which gallantly reverberate <hi>Apollo's</hi> yellow flames in a rich and delightfull ſplendor. Two are eſpecially note-worthy in their Antick ſteeples and Moſaick curioſity. The one is ſquare, fifty foot high in the body, leaded in ſome part, covered with gold and blue; the walls varniſht and wrought with knots and poeſies, vaſt and unfurniſht (or unfiniſht) within; above, ſpiring in two columns or pillars of wood round, cut and garniſht with great bravery, very neer as high as <hi>Paules</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> The (other) rather reſembling a royall Carvanſ-raw) is quadrangular; the ſuperficies of Arabique invention, imboſt with gold, flagd with porphyre, painted with azure, garniſhed in many od mazes, and made reſplendent at ſome ſolemnities by a thouſand Lamps and Torches.</p>
            <p>The other Moſques are not ſo excellent, nor yet ſo baſe as not to invite the buſie eye, regarding novelties. What they want in Architecture, they ſupply in reliques, venerably accounted of for intombing the rotten car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes of ſome Alcoranniſh Doctors, whoſe hypocriſie have got ſuch repute with thoſe ſuperſtitious Ideots, that their Prieſts are fat, their Tombes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt by ſuperfluity of Zeale, no coſt, no paines thought enough to manifeſt the integrity of (impious) devotion. Some ſepulchers are framd of Marble, pure and ſhining. Others of wood, cut into Antique carving, others expreſſe the painters Art, and others the Sculpters skill in braſſe, in plate and coſtly mettall. Where Art is defective, Nature (out of the treaſures of darkneſſe) has dignified them. In one place, <hi>Shaw-meer-Ally-Hamzy</hi> a prophetique Mahomitan reſts his bones, ſeven hundred yeares ſince ferried by <hi>Charon</hi> into <hi>Acheron</hi> for doating upon his deceitfull <hi>Alcaron.</hi> Threeſcore paces long I found the Moſque he is buried in, and in breadth juſt ſo many. In another, ſleeps <hi>Sandant-Emyr-amahow</hi> contemporary with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and equally holy; with many moe, who are like to ſleep till the Trumpet raiſe them. Upon many of theſe Moſques the Storks have pyld their neſts. A bird (as of the Aegyptians, ſo) of theſe people, divinely eſtemated.</p>

Somewhat of <hi>Emangoly-cawn,</hi> the great Duke and his Banquet.</p>
            <p>This brave man is a Georgian by diſcent, a Muſlulman by profeſſion, a Time-ſerver for preferment: is one of thoſe foure Tetrarchs, that under <hi>Abbas</hi> rule the Empire: his Territories reach every way welnigh ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles, and affoord him the Titles of Arck-Duke of <hi>Shyraz,</hi> Sultan of <hi>Larr</hi> and <hi>Iaarown,</hi> Lord of <hi>Ormus, Maqueroon, Kermoen, Chuſiſtan, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtan</hi> and <hi>Farſiſtan,</hi> Prince of the gulph of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and Iles there; the great Beglerbeg, commander of twelve Sultans, fifty thouſand horſe, ſlave to

               <hi>Shaw-Abbas,</hi> protector of Muſſelmen, flower of courteſy, ſecond in glory, Nutmeg of comfort, and Roſe of delight.</p>
            <p>Hee is of a miraculous deſcent for nobleneſſe (as honour goes in theſe parts) his father and grand-father being Dukes afore him; and which is no leſſe admirable, is priviledg'd from degradation by oath from <hi>Abbas:</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion: <hi>Aliculican</hi> his father was victorious in many pitcht bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells againſt <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Tartar,</hi> adding no ſmall luſtre to <hi>Mahomet Codoban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daes</hi> Diadem: moſt memorably, when (by command of <hi>Amurath</hi>) the ſawcy Baſha of <hi>Rhyvan</hi> with fifteene hundred muſquets breath'd defiance againſt <hi>Morad</hi> the <hi>Chielfall</hi> governor in <hi>Armenia,</hi> for daring to ſide with <hi>Iſmael</hi> in that famous overthrow they gave the inſolent Turks, <hi>Anno</hi> 1514 in the <hi>Calderan</hi> plains. <hi>Morad</hi> thus ſuddenly aſſaulted, ſends a timerous excuſe, which rather inrages the Baſſa, implacable till <hi>Morad</hi> had glutted his greedie appetite with burniſht gold, two thouſand pound comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him thence to <hi>Naſsivan</hi> (old <hi>Artaxata</hi>) by that time hungry againe. <hi>Alicolichan</hi> (<hi>Shaw Mahomets</hi> Lieftenant in <hi>Georgia</hi>) rates <hi>Morad,</hi> &amp; vows to make the Turk to eat cold Iron, meat the <hi>Baſha</hi> car'd not for, but by <hi>Ally-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi> fierce charge with a gallant troop of ſix thouſand horſe, made him returne his bribe, and flie as if the Devill had beene in his guts, without more prating over <hi>Anti Taurus</hi> (calld <hi>Mezis Taur</hi>) ſcarce thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſafe in any place, whiles the valiant <hi>Georgian</hi> extracted a treble ſumme from <hi>Morad</hi> for his levity, returning a triumphant victor to the Court, recompenced with the <hi>Sheraz</hi> Dukedome and his ſonne after him, who has prov'd no leſſe fortunate in <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> his field-ſervices, having quieted <hi>Georgia,</hi> ſubdued <hi>Larr,</hi> part of <hi>Arabia, Diarbec,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ormus.</hi> All which it ſeemes is now forgotten, the young <hi>Sha-Soffy</hi> firſt cutting off his ſonnes head the young <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> and when the great Duke was ſinging to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Tutum me copia fecit.

But though he be dead, his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet and reſpect to us muſt not bee forgotten, <hi>Ingrato homine terra pejus nil creat;</hi> ſayes <hi>Auſonius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At our being here, he had abſented himſelfe of purpoſe: and albeit Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> took the paines to ride to him, and tell him his error, hee anſwered; It was no diſhonour for any man (his Maſter excepted) to ſtay his leaſure: but if our Lord Ambaſſador had had his guard and other furniture, wee had gone away without his Licence. After ſix dayes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance his Greatneſſe was pleaſd to viſit <hi>Sheraz,</hi> followed by two thouſand horſe, &amp; moſt unmanerly took his eaſe two dayes after, without any reſpect or note taking of the Ambaſſador. At length, he ſent a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to bid him come and viſit him, returning with this anſwer, hee was weary having come a great journey, and that his buſineſſe was to ſee his Maſter, hee knew not him. The Duke ſtorms to be ſo ſlighted, but durſt not affront him, (knowing the King had commanded his whole Kingdome to honour and bid him heartily welcome) ſo after ſome pauſe, ſent word he meant next day to viſit him; but faild in his promiſe, his ſonne the Beglerbeg (eighteene yeere old) being ſent to excuſe him. Next day, our Ambaſſador ſent word by <hi>Shoc-Ally-beg</hi> to the Dukes ſonne, his viſit ſhould be retaliated. <hi>Emangoly-cawn</hi> is angry no more reſpect was had of him,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20354:75"/>
wondring what kind of people wee were, ſince his owne in a ſort adored him. But ſee how ſubtilly they intrapt him; for he was no ſooner aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Dukes Pallace, but by <hi>Shoc-Ally-beg</hi> is welcomed, and by him uſhered (our Lord knew not whither) into a long gallery, rich in beauties, plate, carpets, and other furniture, where (like a Statua) the Duke himſelfe at the very end ſat croſſe-legd, not moving one jot till the Ambaſſador was at him; when (as if he had beene afrighted) hee skipt up, and bad him welcome; vouchſafeing alſo (upon knowledge that we were gentlemen) to imbrace us, and provide us a banquet. So after two houres merriment departed, invited to returne next day to a more ſolemne welcome. Next day being come, wee were uſhered by a Sultan thorw two great courts into a rich and ſtately banqueting houſe, a large open roome, ſupported with twenty richly guilded pillars, the roofe imboſt with flaming gold, the ground ſpread with rich carpets of ſilke and gold, a ſtate at one end of crimſon ſatten, thick imbroydered with pearles and gold, under which hee was to in-throne himſelfe; one ſide moſt excellently depicted his <hi>Ormus</hi> Trophyes; no coſt, no Art left out to do it to the life; their incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſhoare, their aſſaults, ſcaladoes, and entrance; the maſſacre of the Ormouſians, ſome beheaded, ſome cheyn'd, ſome their heads ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for girdles: as alſo the Engliſh ſhips and ſea skirmiſhes, without whoſe help it never had beene gained, and the like ſo well painted.</p>

            <p>Before the proud Duke meant to diſplay his radiance: my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador was ſeated on the left ſide of the ſtate (you may note if you pleaſe, that all <hi>Aſia</hi> over, the left hand as the ſword hand, is moſt honorable) upon the other ſide ſat the diſcontented Prince of <hi>Tartary;</hi> at my Lords left hand was ſeated the <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi> and next him the captive King of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Next to the <hi>Tartar</hi> Prince ſat <hi>Threbis-cawn</hi> a diſconſolate Prince of <hi>Georgia,</hi> a brave warrior, a conſtant Chriſtian: oppoſite to the ſtate Sir <hi>Robert</hi> ſeated himſelfe: and with us were placed the two Princes of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and ſome Sultans. The reſt of the great banquetting roome was fild with men of eſpeciall note, Sultans; rich Merchants, and Cooſelbaſhaes: young Ganimeds arrayed in cloth of gold, went up and downe with fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons of pure gold to powre out wine to ſuch as noded for it: upon the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets were ſpread fine coloured pintado Table cloaths, forty ells long; broad thin pancakes ſix one upon another ſerved for trenchers, neere which were ſcattered wodden ſpoons, whoſe handles were almoſt a yard long; the ſpoone it ſelfe ſo thick, ſo wide, as requir'd a right ſpatious mouth for entertainment: The feaſt begins: it was compounded of a hundred ſorts of pelo and candid dried meats; as alſo of Dates, Peares,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20354:75"/>
and Peaches curiouſly conſerved, ſuch I took beſt notice of (I meane as pleaſd me beſt) were Iaacks, Myrabolans, Duroyens, Piſtachoes, Almonds, Apricocks, Quinces, Cherries, and the reſt I leave to the confectioner to inquire after. It ſeemes we are ſo infatuated with our banquet and wine, that the Duke is not taken notice of, pray pardon: he is not yet come, that when our bellies are full, our eyes may have the better leiſure to ſurveigh his greatneſſe. The feaſt being ended, the vulgar multitude ſtrove to rend the sky with <hi>Yough Ally-Whoddaw-Baſhat, i.e. Ally</hi> and God bee thanked: the Eccho was as a watch-word to the ambitious Duke that hee might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: his way was made by thirty gallant young gentlemen veſted in crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſatten; their Tulipants were of ſilk and ſilver wreath'd about with cheynes of gold, of Pearle, of Rubies, Turquoiſes, and Emeralds: all of them were girded with rich ſwords and imbroydered ſcabards; they had Hawkes upon their fiſts, each hood valuing a hundred pound. To theſe ſucceeded their Lord, the Arch-Duke of <hi>Sheraz:</hi> his coat was of blew ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten richly imbroydered with ſilver, upon which he wore a Veſt or Roab of great length, ſo glorious to the eye, ſo thick powdered with Orientall glittering Gemms, as made the ground of it inviſible, the price invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: his Turbant was of pure fine ſilke and gold, be ſtudded wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h pearle and Carbuncles; his ſcabbard was ſet all over with Rubies, Pearles, and Emralds; his Sandalls reſembled the beſpangled Firmament. To this Idoll, all the people of his religion ſacrifiz'd a hundred Sizaedaes, and Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems, bowing and knocking their cockſ-combs againſt the ground: Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> alſo ſizaedaed very formally, and in a cup of pure gold drunk his Graces health, and then put it in his pocket; paying him home with this complement; That after ſo mean a perſon as himſelfe had breath'd in it, it was impiety to offer it him: the Duke accepts it as good coyne, and perceiving our Ambaſſador very ſad, darted him a ſmile, drunk his Maſters health, bad him and his heartily welcome, and ſo went in againe: our Lord Ambaſſador alſo ſcarce well pleaſed at the Dukes proud carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, diſſembled it; and after reciprocall Sallams or bendings (none but a few Coſelbaſhaws attending him to his horſe) departed:</p>
            <p>Well may this grand Duke buy his renowne at thoſe high rates, his rents being bruited ſo great, ſo wonderfull: hee has (ſay Merchants) foure hundred thouſand Tomans a yeere (a Toman is five marks ſterling) but out of this hee payes wages yeerely to fifty thouſand horſemen: his plate and jewels is valued at three hundred thouſand pounds, ſome ſay three Millions, and is pretty well deſcried by that New-yeeres gift hee ſent the King (upon <hi>Meloembeg</hi> the Fiſcalls prompting) three yeeres ſince: <hi>viz:</hi> fifty great flagons of pure gold, ſeventy two of refined ſilver: in <hi>Larrees</hi> foure hundred ſixty five thouſand floryns: the whole, loading three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty cozel-baſh Camels, a valuable preſent: and for which the King (as a Symbole of his gratitude) remunerates the Duke with fifty gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Arabian Courſers, ſix change of rich garments, a ſword, and (of more value than the reſt) the aſſurance of his health and dignity.</p>
            <p>This Duke here and in other Seralios (or Harams, as the Perſians term them) has above three hundred Concubines; Mawmetry commending it: there is no other way in theſe Pagan countries to diſtinguiſh one mans

greatneſſe from another, ſave by exceeding in their females: hee hunts elſewhere, other ſports ſerving as a provocation to baſe venery: nor do they refraine more manly exerciſes; chaſing the Lion, hunting the Tygre, diſlodging the Bore, unkennelling the Iackall, and the like; at which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſports he beſets whole countries with above twenty thouſand men, who ſerve to rouze all kind of ſavage game, and when the whole heard are in battelled upon ſome ſpacious Mountaine, impales it with a huge Toyle of wyre and cord ſtak't with wood (ſix hundred Cammels load) and ſo either dart them from without the raile, or venture in, and (by drawing a croſſe line) ſingle what beaſt they pleaſe to fight with.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after the great feaſt, the Duke with a gallant traine of thirty Sultans and Cooſelbaſhaws came galloping to <hi>Ally-cawn,</hi> (ſo is the houſe named we lodged at;) and albeit he endeavoured to aſſault us with a ſudden viſit, yet ſuch was the excellent fore-ſight and vivacity of our Ambaſſador, attending all occaſions of advantage; that at his alighting, he found a choice ſhade for his recreation, chambers neatly furniſht, from his Balcony look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a moſt fragrant &amp; pleaſant garden, where the Paphyan cipreſſes, &amp; other rare trees in their aparel, repeld the guilded rayes of wanton <hi>Phaeton:</hi> here the facetious Duke incampt and all his company; reſolv'd to incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the utmoſt fury of his owne ſtrong wine, and our Engliſh chymick wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: three houres the fight continued hot, charging one another with equall valour; many ſtout bottles and flagons were emptied and buried, but by ſtrange ſtratagem revived afreſh, thundring ſo fierce a ſtorme in the Dukes braines, that hee ſell back and had undone himſelfe, had not my Lord Ambaſſador by great chance upheld and horſt him: the reſt percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Generall ſo ſtrangely vanquiſht, ſound a retreat, and ſtudy how to untwiſt their braines from out that magick labyrinth: Mr. <hi>Stodart</hi> of Caernarvan, a bold Britton, and Mr.<hi>Emery</hi> playd <hi>Bóotes:</hi> Next day the Duke made his excuſe, and returnd his thanks in a Preſent of twelve brave horſes, with bridles and ſaddles ſuting them; by which it ſeemes all of them were pleas'd and the Ambaſſador (who without ſuch an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had never pleas'd them, though infinitly contrary to his temper) was crownd with th' applauſe of a noble, diſcreet, liberall, and well faſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gentleman. After many other ceremonies of welcome (in which time, piſcaſhes and gifts were not left out) we had leave to ſet on towards the Court; I call it leave, the Duke was ſo unwilling to part with us: wee were bravely mounted, furniſht with freſh Cammells and Aſinegoes, able to endure the brunt of travell.</p>
            <p>Six and twenty dayes wee conſumed in <hi>Sheraz,</hi> forced to ſo long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morance by the merry Duke; and on Lady day in Lent, departed thence for <hi>Spahawn</hi> the Perſian Metropolis.

            <p>Let us now (what pace you pleaſe) to <hi>Perſe-polis,</hi> not much out of the road: but were it a thouſand times further, it merits our paines to view it; being indeed the only bravo Antique-Monument (not in Perſia alone) but through all the Orient.</p>
            <p>PERSEPOLIS, (firſt call'd <hi>Elamis</hi> from <hi>Elam</hi> ſonne of <hi>Sem</hi> ſonne of <hi>Noah</hi>) was built (enlarg'd rather) by <hi>Soſarmus</hi> a Median Dynaſt, third from <hi>Arbaces</hi> that put a period (by death of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>) to the Aſſyrian Monarchy, begun by <hi>Belus</hi> (<hi>Nymrod</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi>) and in a glorious ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one and forty Emperours commanding the world, till <hi>Arbaces</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Babylon. By <hi>Cambyſes</hi> (ſonne to <hi>Cyrus</hi> the magnificent) it was moſt beautified, and from him to <hi>Darius Codomanus</hi> continued Empreſſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> two hundred &amp; thirty yeares in a line of thirteen Monarchs, till <hi>Alexander</hi> by conqueſt of all <hi>Aſia</hi> made proſtrate alſo this glorious Citie, betrayed by <hi>Teredates,</hi> and demoliſht by vehement perſwaſion of <hi>Thais</hi> an Athenian harlot, who (in revenge of <hi>Xerxe's</hi> expedition into Greece) never gave over exaſperating the giddy Macedonian, till ſhee ſaw it flaming; an act ſo unworthy <hi>Alexander</hi> as hee ſought to quench it with his teares. A Citie ſo excellent, that <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> intitle it the richeſt and moſt lovely Citie under the Sunne. A high and ſtately Tower it had, circled with a triple Wall: ſixteene cubits high the firſt, adorn'd with battlements; the ſecond was two and thirty; the third of threeſcore cubits high, of delicate poliſht Marble, entred by many gates of burniſht braſſe. To the Eaſt roſe amiably a hill of foure Akers, in which (in ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mauſoleums) were intombed the Monarchs of the world. Many rare and admirable buildings it had, amongſt which, the glorious Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> (mother to that at <hi>Epheſus</hi>) by <hi>Ioſephus</hi> report was at that time the moſt exquiſite for Art &amp; material in the world. The ſtones were of richeſt Marble and Porphire, the roofe of refined gold. A bayt <hi>Antiochus</hi> the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious Atheiſt long had nibled at, but could not ſwallow it, as he had done Jeruſalems, whence ſacrilegiouſly he raviſht ten tunne of gold. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace royall here, was cut out of the marble rock, above two miles about; the roofe and caſements were of Gold, Silver, Amber, &amp; Ivory. The State within, was of gold and orientall glittering gems, in one roome an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Vine (preſented by <hi>Pythius</hi>) the ſtalk pure gold, the cluſters of pearls and carbuncles; his bolſter was valued at five thouſand Talents of gold, his footſtoole worth three thouſand; ſuch, as (after the unruly Greeks had pillag'd three dayes) gave the Macedonian Victor for his part, 120000 Talents, or 72 millions of crownes, a maſſe of gold: yet very poſſible, if it be true old Hiſtories report (<hi>Herodotus</hi> is one) how that at that time, the Monarchs of Perſia (beſides the Tribute of other Kingdomes) had yeerely
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20354:78"/>
out of Indya three hundred and threeſcore Talents of gold. Eaſily then might the Greek load away (as ſtory ſayes) three thouſand Mules, with two and thirty millions and 750000 pounds in coyne, though in that ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcency of the world, one would wonder ſo much treaſure was found. But we may beleeve it, ſince ſacred writ tells us that in <hi>Solomons</hi> reigne, in Jeruſalem gold and ſilver was as common as ſtones. Alſo <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that when <hi>Cyrus</hi> deſcended into Aſia the leſſe, hee brought back no leſſe than 125 millions of pounds. But why ſtand we gaping at theſe prodigious ſums. <hi>Pauper enim non eſt, cui rerum ſuppetit uſus.</hi> Theſe ſparkling Diamonds, what are they but Mammons eyes; this Chaos of gold, but refined clay. What Magick then to make Idolaters. For my part (by Gods help) I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend rather to admire the Anatomy of this glorious ruine, which <hi>Don Garzia de Silva Figuroa</hi> (Ambaſſador <hi>Anno</hi> 1619 to <hi>Abbas</hi> from <hi>Philip</hi> the third) calls it the only Monument of the world, without Impoſture; yea farre exceeding (ſayes he) all other miracles in the world, wee can either heare or ſee at this day. Miſerable in my poore deſcription.</p>
            <p>The ribs or ruines of <hi>Perſepolis</hi> are at this day call'd <hi>Chil-Manor</hi> or <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hel-Manor</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> forty Towers) in the idiom of Perſia: and might more properly have ſaid <hi>Haſhtot-Manor,</hi> or eighty Towers, for ſo many are eaſily told two yards out of the ground; and if from ſo many pillars as are perfect and lofty, then may they ſay <hi>Nouzda-Manor</hi> or nineteene Towers, at this day no more ſtanding, one excepted at the Eaſt below, above a bow ſhot thence.

               </gap> by incredible toyle, out of the ſolid marble rock, twice the compaſſe of <hi>Wyndſor</hi> Caſtle, aſcended by foureſcore and fifteene eaſie ſtaires, diſſected from the durable black Marble, ſo broad that a dozen horſe may goe abreaſt: the perpendicular is two and twenty Geometric feet, and where the ſtaires are not, the rock is precipitious. Neere the higheſt ſtep, is the entrance into the Palace; the breadth is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in deſpight of flame and weather: on one ſide the gate ſtands a monſtrous great Elephant, on the other a Rhinoceros; the diſtance is about twenty foot, the portraicts are out of the ſhining Marble, ten yards high either of them, fixt and perpetuall: a few paces thence, are of like work, bulk and matter two gallant Towers, and (to finiſh the Porters Lodge) neere them is an other ruine, a Pegaſus an invention of the Sculptor to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate his Art: and being paſt this portall, the Apollo opens, a faire even ground, deplorable in many ruines, a hundred white Marble pillars, whole and broken dignifying this once moſt excellent ſtructure. Upon many of theſe white Marble pillars the Storks have builded them their neſts, where the rage of winde and weather is more offenſive to them than any dread they have of the people who inhabit neere them: in all unſeaſonable ſtormy or cold weather they forſake the Region and fly where the Sunne can comfort them: the Perſians have many ſuperſtitious ſtories concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em, and ſuppoſe them (as elſe-where I have noted) the Emblems of piety and gratitude. The Pillars which are at this day ſtanding, (but ſeeme to groane under the tyrannie of Time) are twixt fifteene &amp; twenty cubits high, &amp; riſe beautifully in forty ſquares or concave parallels; every ſquare has three full inches; whereby the circuit may be gathered: moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent is the matter, moſt elegant the work, and no leſſe commendable, the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20354:78"/>
order and ſhape how they are placed: in poſture, in ſhew, to this day ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable; but when they ſtood in luſtre and perfection, were elſe-where ſcarce imitable. From the ordinary ſtanding, we eaſily enjoyed a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull proſpect: but in the ſummity or advantage a brave Horizon of thirty miles unlimitted Plains every way gave it ſelfe to this Emperial Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, as ſeeming to ſubmit it ſelfe in a happy lowlineſſe.</p>

            <p>In part of this great roome (not farre from the portall) in a mirrour of poliſht marble, wee noted above a dozen lynes of ſtrange characters, very
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20354:79"/>
faire and apparent to the eye, but ſo myſticall, ſo odly framed, as no Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogliphick, no other deep conceit can be more difficultly fancied, more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the intellect. Theſe conſiſting of Figures, obelisk, triangular, and pyramidall, yet in ſuch Simmetry and order as cannot well be called barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Some reſemblance, I thought ſome words had of the Antick Greek, ſhadowing out <hi>Ahaſhuerus Theos.</hi> And though it have ſmall concordance with the Hebrew, Greek, or Latine letter, yet queſtionleſſe to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter it was well knowne; and peradventure may conceale ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter, though to this day wrapt up in the dim leafes of envious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie.</p>
            <p>Adjoyning this, is another ſquare roome, from angle to angle ninety paces, in circuit three hundred and threeſcore paces: beautified with eight dores, foure of them are ſix paces broad; the other foure, three a peece: all eight ſeverally compoſd of ſeven great poliſht Marbles fixt one upon another; each of thoſe ſtones are foure yards logn, five quarters high, moſt excellently ingraven with Images of Lyons, Gryffins, Tigres, and Bulls: and in other places (for the wals are durable) Battailes, Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs, Triumphs, Olympick games, and the like, in very rare Sculpture and proportion. Above each doore is ingraven the Idea of a Majeſtique Monarch; his roabe is long, a <hi>Tiara</hi> or <hi>Mithra</hi> on his head, his hayre very long and curled; in one hand he holds a Globe, in the other his Scepter, a garbe and ſeſſion never uſed by Perſian Princes. The ſilly inhabitants (who made no accompt of it till of late) name him, <hi>Iamſhet,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> a wonder they leave out <hi>Ruſtan</hi> their <hi>Hercules,</hi> and as eaſie for invention. A third chamber conjoynes the laſt we ſpoke of, this (if they lie not that told us ſo) was a Gynecie or Nurſery; it has foure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall angles, two ſides are ſixtie; the other two, ſeventy of my largeſt paces. From that we iſſued into a fourth roome, two ſides are twenty, the other two, thirty paces. The walls are very eminent in this chamber, of black ſhining Marble, in many places ſo bright and jetty, as we could eaſily view our reflex, no ſteel mirror comparing with it. In moſt parts the walls are cut into Gygantive Images, illuſtrated with Gold, to this day permanent. Somewhat further, over heaps of ſtones of valewable portraictures, we mount towards the moſt lofty part of this Pallace, where we ſaw the reſemblances of a devout King, adoring his three Dietyes, the Sunne, the Fire, a Serpent, all which are cut upon the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Mountaine. The other ſide of this high hill is a precipice, downe which is no deſcending. But whether this Fabrick was <hi>Ionick, Dorick,</hi> or <hi>Corinthiack,</hi> in the perfection, I cannot determine, the ruines forbid a poſitive judgement. But ſuch at this day it is, that a ready Lymmer in three moneths ſpace can hardly (to do it well) depict out all her excellencies. Pitty it is, it is not done, the barbarous people every day defacing it and cleaving it aſunder for grave-ſtones and benches to ſit upon. Five miles Weſt from <hi>Chehel-manor</hi> is alſo a gallant Monument, a Giant cut into a monſtruous proportion, whom the illiterate Perſians ſay was <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> and from him cald <hi>Nocta-Ruſtan.</hi> I rather judge it the Image of great <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> who had a deſire, that after ages might think him more than a man, and his men more than Monſters, as appeared in his conceit to make
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20354:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many Armors, bigg enough for three men, and ſcatter them in <hi>India</hi> that the people might not dare to rebell, leſt thoſe Poliphems came to laſh them.</p>
            <p>Neere <hi>Chilmanor</hi> is <hi>Mardaſh</hi> (corruptly by the Spaniard cald <hi>Margate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) a Towne of two hundred houſes, the people ſo ſuperſtitious that ſuch houſes as we came in they perfumd and ayr'd (ſome were happily fired) for that we were not Muſſulmen. From this place to <hi>Sheraz</hi> are ten far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſangs; interpoſd by ſome craggy hills and a pleaſant river (<hi>Rhogomana</hi> of old) over which is a bridge, the beſt till then we ſaw in <hi>Perſia.</hi> This river is by <hi>Quintus Curtius lib.</hi> 5. and <hi>Strabo lib.</hi> 15. named <hi>Araxis</hi> (<hi>Cho-Araxes</hi> is a fitter name) ſtreaming (ſayes he) twentie furlongs from <hi>Perſepolis.</hi> Another of that name, ſo often mentioned by <hi>Ptol. Mela, Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> is in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and indeed divides it from <hi>Medya,</hi> at this day cald <hi>Araſh</hi>) and very famous.</p>
            <p>After two dayes ſtay in view of old <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> the eight and twentieth day we took horſe, and that night rid foure and twentie miles to a Town cald <hi>Moy own;</hi> in midway twixt which two Townes, we noted a high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable mount, at whoſe top, ſtood deſperately a Caſtle ſo fortified by Nature and induſtrie, as may be thought impregnable. A late rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Sultan (weary of ſlavery) man'd it againſt his Prince victorious <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> who (to terrifie others by his example) came in perſon to chaſtiſe him. But ſuch was the precipitious height where the Caſtle ſtood, and the narrow entrance ſo bravely defended, that in ſix moneths ſiege hee could ſee no ſigne of victory. Loth he is to leave it ſo, and what ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem to take, cannot imagin. A great reward he promiſes to any would ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. Valour is invalidable. Art Magique perpetrates it. An old wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard covetous of ſo much money promiſes the Divells beſt, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by his infernall ſpells ſo poſſeſt with threats and phantaſmaes the wretched Sultan, that upon the witches aſſurance of pardon he deſcends, the block rewards him. But <hi>Abbas</hi> acknowledges the Inchanter had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited his price and grudgingly gave it him. The fooliſh man ſo doates upon his gold, that he ſees not danger. The King repents the loſſe of it, and knowes no way to recover it but by ſending him to Satan without his head, the reaſon of his Juſtice was for his Sorcery. A quality at other times he commended deeply, but now abhorred it: a pretty pollicy. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>

               <hi>Moyown,</hi> is delightfully ſeated; enricht with ſweet water, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Wine, much wood, and Natures Carpets. It properly belongs to the highly reverenced Prophet <hi>Izmael,</hi> whoſe tombe <hi>Emoom-Izmael</hi> is here ſeen, by liberality of many Kings, and great men not a little honoured: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its maintenance (and the Prieſts) the Towne gives yearly twelve thouſand mawnd-ſhaw of Rice, and foure thouſand of Barley. Next night we lodgd (ſlept I cannot ſay) in <hi>O-jone,</hi> a village of thirty Families, all of them Prophets or Prophets children. We ever found leaſt profit, where Prophets dwelt, no wine nor grapes allowd to grow amongſt them; not that wine is bad, but out of a Tradition they have, that it is the blood of thoſe Gyants that warr'd againſt the Gods. Next day we rode over moſt craggy, ſteep, and terrible high hills, and at night made <hi>Tartang</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:20354:80"/>

Next night to <hi>Aſſepoſe,</hi> notable only in an old mud Caſtle, ſometimes a garriſon; in and about which, are fourty thouſand Georgians and Sarcaſshes, by profeſſion Chriſtians; by quality, Captives; a people much honouring Saint <hi>George</hi> the Cappadocian Biſhop their converter.

Next night we were uſherd to <hi>Spawhawnet</hi> by a ſervant of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyembegs</hi> the Kings Fiſcall who intreated the Ambaſſadors to repoſe a day or two there, till <hi>Spahawn</hi> had fitted it ſelfe for a ſolemne intertainment: where whiles we repoſe we may remember, that moſt of thoſe <hi>Manzeils</hi> we have paſt from <hi>Chehelmanor</hi> to his place, are twixt twenty and thirtie miles aſunder. The whole diſtance is ſomewhat above two hundred miles, as I computed them.</p>
            <p>The tenth of Aprill wee ſet out from <hi>Spahawnet</hi> a village ſix miles South from <hi>Spahawn:</hi> when we had gone a farſang (three miles,) we were ſtayed by the way to taſte a banquet in a ſpacious garden of the Kings, whither the Engliſh Agent and ſuch other Chriſtian Merchants as were in <hi>Spahawn</hi> came out to attend our Lord Ambaſſador: a mile neerer the Citie, the Viſier, the Sultan of <hi>Spahawn, Meloyembeg</hi> and <hi>Hodge-nazar</hi> the Armenian Prince with foure thouſand horſe and innumerable foot, came to bid us a happy entrance: the fields two miles from the towne were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſht with vulgar men, women and childen; the <hi>Bannyans</hi> like caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſwarmd about us; all together, in a volley of thundering acclamations cried out <hi>Hoſhomody, Suffowardy,</hi> the better ſort <hi>Hoſhgaldom</hi> i.e. welcome, heartily welcome: forty kettle Drums, Fifes, Tabrets Tymbrels, dancing wenches, Hocus Pocuſſes, and other Anticks paſt my numbring inobled the ceremony: the bridge was full of women on both ſides, many of them in faire deportment unmaſqued their faces. The firſt place we alighted at was the <hi>Conna-potſhaugh,</hi> the Kings Pallace, placed at the Weſt ſide of the Medan or great Market: there the Noble men kneeled downe, and <hi>teſſalemd,</hi> three times kiſſing the Kings threſhold, and as many times knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heads againſt the ground in an awfull obeyſance: Sir <hi>Robert Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> ſizedaed alſo and contented them; a Coſelbaſh ended the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in a panegyrick to this purpoſe: That the Fame and excellency of <hi>Shaw-Abbas</hi> was ſo great as had attracted a great Prince and other Gentlemen from the extreameſt Angle of the world, to ſee whether fame had been partiall in his magnificence: no wonder, ſince his radiant beames ſpread themſelves over all the Univerſe: that done, ſome bottles of good Wine were laviſht out, after which with a continued clamour of the Plebeyans, we were conducted to a brave houſe of the Kings, at the South-Eaſt end of the City, through which, a deep broad water had its courſe into the <hi>Sindery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth day after our being in <hi>Spahawn,</hi> the Engliſh Agent banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Lord Ambaſſador, and ſhewed us a rich and hearty welcome: to agrandize it, at night a Tanck of water was beſet with lighted Tapers, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially uniting the two contrary Elements; ſquibs alſo and other fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, that made all the City gaze and gape with wonder. Next day <hi>Hodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nazar</hi> was viſited at his houſe in <hi>Ielphea;</hi> a Chriſtian he profeſſes himſelfe, but (I muſt be bold to tell him) his houſe is furniſht with ſuch beaſtly pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, as no way reliſh of honeſt or Chriſtian invention: amongſt our other

They have the old and new Teſtaments in their mother tongue; the Letany alſo, part of which, is every Lords day read and expounded in the Churches: they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Lords Supper in both kinds, Bread and Wine; and deny a reall preſence; they allow but our two Sacraments: Baptiſme they celebrate after the Eutichyan ſort, as <hi>Iacobus</hi> (father of the <hi>Iacobites</hi>) and <hi>Iohannes Philipponus Anno Dom.</hi> 550 miſ-taught them: the proſelit gentiles or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humedans in the fore-head with a burning croſſe, others they baptiſe with two fingers, and ſigne the Infant with the croſſe, as glorying in that hyerogliphick the Jews and Muſſulmen eſteeme ſo ignominiouſly of: are alſo great lovers of Tradition: they pray not for the dead, imagining that till the generall day of doom they are without joy or torture. Five Sabbaths in every yeare they abſtaine from fleſh, fiſh, cheeſe, and butter; in memory of thoſe five Ages, wherein their barbarous forefathers uſed to immolate their children unto the old red Dragon: all wedneſdayes and fridayes alſo in the yeare except from Eaſter to Aſcention they faſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely: and no other Chriſtians are ſuch ſtrict Lent-obſervers: for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayne their wives that time; and from fleſh, fiſh, milk, egges, butter; thoſe forty dayes feeding only upon oyle, bread, honey, water, dates, cowcumbers, melons, herbs, and the like. At other times they eat hogs fleſh. Before the three great Feſtivalls, they faſt twelve dayes: they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry betimes at nine or twelve yeers: the Layety are permitted to wed twice the Eccleſiaſtiques but once: trigamy to all is hatefull.

Obedience and reſpect to the better and elder ſort is much practiſd. They puniſh theft and adultery ſeverely. In ſome things they are but refind Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters: as in ſome burialls, they lead about the Church an unſpotted Lambe with much ſolemnity; they then ſacrifice, divide and give each there a bitt to eat; as a Simbol, or ſuperſtitious bond, obliging one another in love and charity: to mee it ſeems they derive this cuſtome from that of the Hebrews, who uſed to divide a calfe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> records in 15. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. and as <hi>Ieremie</hi> notes in the 34 <hi>Ch.</hi> 18.19. verſes.

by a repreſentative body, uſing all that morning the old ſalute of joy; He is riſen indeed: an Angelicall note they call it.

D.</hi> 1474, <hi>Ioſeph Barbarus</hi> was here (<hi>Vſan Caſſan</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) and hee deſcribes <hi>Spahawn</hi> to bee a great and famous City, peopled with 1500000 ſoules, the Towne and Suburbs ten miles in compaſſe. <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Contarenus</hi> the Venetian Ambaſſ. 80 yeere ago, relate that then ſhee had 20 Italian miles in circuit, and <hi>Lemius</hi> the Portuguiſe ſent by <hi>Albuquerq</hi> to <hi>Sha-Iſmael, An.

            <p>I ſhall now more largely, and truly acquaint you with her preſent ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. <hi>Spawhawn,</hi> Metropolis of the Perſian Monarchy, is ſeated in the Parthian Territory now cal'd <hi>Ayrack,</hi> &amp; as Umbelic to that ſpacious bodie at this day awed by the Perſian Scepter: from the Perſian gulph removed a hundred ſeventie nine farſangs, (of Engliſh miles five hundred thirtie ſeven,) from the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea a hundred and twenty farſangs (three hundred and ſixty miles;) from <hi>Shyraz</hi> two hundred twenty two miles, from <hi>Babylon</hi> foure hundred and fifty, from <hi>Candahor</hi> eight hundred and ſeventie, from <hi>Cazbyn</hi> 270. In compaſſe at this day nine Engliſh miles,<note place="margin">Circuit.</note> including ſeventy thouſand houſes, and of ſoules above two hundred thouſand, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd (beſides Natives) of Engliſh, Duch, Portuguiz', Pole, Muſcovit, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, Arabian, Armenian, Georgian, Turk, Jew, and others, drawne thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the magnetick power of gaine and novelty: many things here are memorable; which for order ſake I will preſent you thus divided. The Mydan, Moſques, Hummums, Gates, Pallaces, Gardens, Monuments, and <hi>Ielphey</hi> the City adjoyning.</p>
            <p>Let me lead you into the Mydan, into the which ere I can bring you,<note place="margin">River.</note> we paſſe over a well-built Bridge of ſtone, ſupported by five and thirty pillars, through which the Syndery (or Zindaren) from the Acrocerau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Mountaines ſtreames gently; ſpreading in rainie ſeaſons here welnigh ſo broad as the Thames at <hi>London,</hi> but nothing ſo navigable; in Summer

her Channells being diſcovered. The Mydan or great Market, is without doubt the moſt ſpacious,<note place="margin">Mydan.</note> pleaſant, and Aromatick Market in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; a thouſand paces from North to South, the other way above two hundred, reſembling our Exchange, or the place Royall in <hi>Paris,</hi> but ſix times larger: the building is of Brick, well made, and in delightfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fabricated; the whole Mydan joyntly continued: the inſide is full of ſhops, each ſhop full of ware, archt above (and in a Cupolo) atop tarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe framed, and with plaiſter (like that of <hi>Paris</hi>) cemented. This My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan being the nobleſt part, is ſo placed in the heart of this triumphant City. The Kings Pallace (or Chonna-Potſhaugh) conjoynes the Weſt ſide of the Mydan, poſſeſſing a large quantity backwards, but juts not to the ſtreet further than the other buildings, nor to the ſtreet ſide gives any magnifick front or ſtate, her beſt bravery being in the trimme, pargetted and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with blew and gold, in moſaick or antick ſort, interlac't with poſies of Arabick, either ſavoring of oſtentation (they deifie their Kings) or for inſtruction from the Alcoran; within, the roomes are archt, enlighten'd by curious trellizes, the roofe imboſt above with red, white, blew, and gold, the ſides with ſports and painted Images; the ground ſpread with rich and curious carpets of ſilke and gold, without other furniture. Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed above, garniſht with a Pharoe over-topping many Moſques, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for view and breathing. The wilderneſſe behinde, is fild with ayery Citizens, priviledg'd from hurt or affrights, and for which they returne their thankfull notes in a more ſwift melodious conſort, than if they were in the exacteſt vollyere in the Vniverſe.</p>
            <p>The North Ile in the Medan, ſhews eight or nine ſpacious archt rooms, hung with Lamps and latten Candleſticks, which being lighted, gives a curious ſplendor. Thither the Potſhaw and others go to ſee paſtimes of tumbling, dancing girls, and painted Catamites, that damned ſinne being tolerated by the Alcoran. The furtheſt end North is appropriate for Mynts; the firſt day ſilver, gold the ſecond, next day braſſe. Not farre thence are victualling ſhops, wherein, to feed the helpfull belly, after the buſie eye and painfull feet are ſatiated.</p>
            <p>Afore the Kings doore, and within the Hippodrome, lye unmounted one and thirty Demicannons of braſſe, and twelve iron Culverins, brought hither (by ſome late over-throw they gave the Portugall or Turk) from <hi>Ormus</hi> or <hi>Babylon.</hi> Oppoſite to this Pallace is a faire Moſque, but that at the South end (of all others) moſt excellent; the outſide ſtone, not form'd to the Croſſe (the hyerogliphic of our ſalvation) as ours bee; but round, either from the Talmud, figuring out Aeternity, or from the Alcaba in <hi>Mecca,</hi> the ſhape whereof was reveal'd to <hi>Abraham</hi> from heaven, pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern'd from that, <hi>Adam</hi> (ſayes their Alcoran) reard in Paradiſe: within 'tis diſtinguiſht into Iles, the wals lined 15 geometrick foot high from the ſole with white well poliſht Marble; without pews or ſeats: in center is a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tanck; and at the portall another, octanguler, fild with criſtall ſtreams which is firſt forced to glide round the inſide the Medan through a ſtone channell ſix foot deep, and ſix in bredth, which after a pleaſant drilling murmur, flowes into this Tanck (or watery Magazeen) whence it is ſuckt out by ſubterranean paſſages into many private houſes and gardens.

call it Paradize: all whoſe excellencies we will joyne in one at the South-Weſt end of <hi>Spawhawn, Nazer-jareeb</hi> by name, a garden famouſed deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly over all this Monarchy.</p>
            <p>If you go from the Medan, you paſſe by <hi>Cherbaugh,</hi> through an even delicate ſtreet two miles long at the leaſt, moſt part of the way wall'd on both ſides, beſtrew'd with Moholls or Summer houſes, but more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in that abundance of greene, broad, ſpreading, Chenore trees, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhade, and incomparable order and beauty; the garden (or rather fruit Forreſt) of <hi>Nazerjareeb</hi> is circled with a ſtately wall about three miles in compaſſe, entred by three gates ſtrong and elegantly ſhaped. From North to South it gave mee a thauſand paces, from Eaſt to Weſt ſeven hundred, from one end to the other eaſily diſcovered, by reaſon a faire open Ally (like that in <hi>Fountain b'leau</hi>) runs along in parellell, diſtinguiſht into nine Aſcents, each ſurmounting other a large foot, each diſtance ſmooth and even. In center, is a ſpatious Tanck, made into twelve equal ſides, each ſide or ſquare is five foot, fild, and round ſet with pipes of lead which (after the Italick ſort) ſpouts out the liquid element in variety of conceits and poſtures; that ſort of paſtime continuing thence to the North gate, where is rais'd a pile of pleaſure, antickly garniſht without; within, divided into foure or ſix chambers; the lower, is ſet out with Tancks of rich white Marble, and fumes out a coole breeſe, by quaffing up ſo much chryſtaline water as makes it bubble thither by a conſtreyned mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cut by incredible toyle thorow the Coronian Mountaine.</p>
            <p>The higher roomes are garniſht with variety of landskips, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents their way of ſporting, hawking, fiſhing, riding, ſhooting, wraſtling, courting, and other fancies; the roofe or ſeeling is inricht with beaten gold, imboſt with azure. But, what ſeemd to mee moſt excellent, was the view we enjoyed from her Tarraſſes, which affoorded us a dainty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of moſt part of the City; which, (ſave at <hi>Ruſtans</hi> Tombe, upon a hill two miles thence) elſewhere cannot be obteyned. This garden is repleniſht with trees of all ſorts; for medicine, for ſhade, for fruit: all ſo greene, ſo ſweet, ſo pleaſant, as may well be term'd a <hi>compendium</hi> of ſenſe-raviſhing delights, or King <hi>Abbas</hi> his Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>Monuments ſhould come now to our deſcription:<note place="margin">Monuments</note> but I found few to feed my eyes upon. <hi>Ruſtans</hi> Tomb muſt be one (two miles from <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawn</hi>) behind the Garden wee laſt ſpoke of: a Tomb ſcarce diſcern'd by ſhape, but by the Gowers <hi>Cabala</hi> preſerv'd from Oblivion. To ſee it, wee foot it to the very top of an Imperious Mount, where is only a hollow Cave, whether cut by Art or Nature ſcarce diſcernable. His grave is here, his Image, at a place neere <hi>Shyraz</hi> (from his gigantive ſhape ingraven of old in a black-marble precipitious mountaine) <hi>Noctae</hi> or <hi>Nogdi Ruſtan,</hi> a brave Cavalier ſuch time as <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (Queen <hi>Heſters</hi> husband) wore that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem. <hi>A.D.</hi> 3500. but envie (the heyre of perdition) ſo burnt in the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart of his unnaturall brother <hi>Shawgad,</hi> that when <hi>Ruſtan</hi> was hot in chaſe, he fell into a dreadfull pit, cover'd with boughes as if it had hatcht no danger, but in proſecuting his hate was alſo ſlaine by a Dart <hi>Ruſtan</hi> flung up to retaliate him. Such was the end of valiant <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> of whom the Gowers (the old Perſians) fable more than we of <hi>Bellyanis</hi> or <hi>Ogero</hi> the Dane.</p>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:20354:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſtant, nothing memorable, ſave an old Caſtle in the way, which, by <hi>Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia's</hi> paleneſſe, we could hardly diſcover. From <hi>Bawt</hi> wee got by break of day to <hi>Obigarmy,</hi> both of them houſes of the Kings, who has at every twelve miles end a ſeverall Lodge betwixt <hi>Spawhawn</hi> and the Caſpian Sea like theſe, and wherein our Ambaſſadour had the honour to repoſe. And now we are paſt the danger; let me tell it you. Moſt part of the laſt night wee croſt a miſerable inhoſpitable ſandie Deſart, ten long miles broad, in length a hundred: where we beheld mountaines of looſe ſand, accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the winds fury in ſuch heaps as upon any great wind the tract is loſt, and paſſengers (too oft) involv'd and ſtifled by that impetuous mercileſſe Tyrant, yea Camels, Horſes, Mules, or other beaſts, though ſtrong, ſwift and ſteady, periſh without mercy: Albeit the King (to do as much as may be for prevention) has rais'd at every 3 miles end a Caſtle, but by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable foundation, is in March &amp; September in deſpight of their beſt props yeerely peece-meale torne aſunder, without any remaines of their late ſtanding. This our laſt nights travell was thirty miles. Next night wee rode one and twenty miles to <hi>Suffedaw,</hi> an old rotten weather-beaten Inn or Carravans-raw, and placed in part of an unſociable Deſart. Our next nights lodging was at <hi>Syacow</hi> ten farſangs (or paraſſangs as <hi>Pliny</hi> calls them) thirty miles Engliſh, notable in her Carravans-raw, built from the ground of good free ſtone, white and poliſht, and was the firſt building of that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall I ſaw in eight hundred miles riding; a word of our laſt nights jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The moſt part of the night we rode upon a cauſey broad enough for ten horſe abreaſt, built by incredible labour and expence over a moſt dreadfull Deſart, eeven and affoording a plaine Horizon of boggy looſe ground, cover'd a top, a yards depth with pure ſalt, as white as ſnow; a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable paſſage, for if either the wind force the ſalt abroad like duſt, or that by any accident Horſe or Camell miſtake the way, the quaggy bogg up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them not, but ſuffers them to ſinck paſt all recoverie; a paſſage more feared, from ſome forlorne hopes that pillage paſſengers; God be bleſt, wee eſcaped this, but not another, little leſſe formidable; for wee had no ſooner paſt the ſalt Deſart, but of neceſſity wee muſt climb over and about hills, ſo high and glomerating, as if <hi>Olympus</hi> had beene cut out into Deda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian labyrinths. From <hi>Syacow</hi> wee rode next night 22 miles, moſt part was over other ſalt vaſt Deſarts wherein thouſands have periſhed, and would yet, did not a like large deepe grounded cauſey ſecure the paſſage: And here we pitcht our Tents, old god <hi>Terminus</hi> in this place limitting <hi>Parthya</hi> from further branching North, from whoſe high tops looke wee back and memorize her that was once Miſtreſſe of <hi>Aſya,</hi> and formidable to the Roman Emperours. In the Scythick tongue ſhee meanes a ſtranger, (as <hi>Iuſtin</hi> in his twelfth book) given by the rude Tartar, as to us the name Welch, by the barbarous Saxon. The Parthyan Diadem was once garniſht with two and twenty Kingdomes, encircling moſt part of <hi>Aſya.</hi> From which luſtre ſhee fell; but after long eclipſe, by vertue of the Sophyan ſtemme, has recover'd a great part of her former bravery. Tis now call'd <hi>Hyerac,</hi> ſirnam'd <hi>Agemy,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from that including <hi>Babylon.</hi> Her old Shires were <hi>Rhagaea, Apamea, Tapira, Choama, Araciana, Semina,</hi> and <hi>Mizia;</hi> her mountaines, <hi>Orontes, Abicoronii, Mardoranii,</hi> and <hi>Parchoatri;</hi> not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20354:88"/>
eight hundred miles in circuit, hilly and barren, yet breeding men both wiſe and valiant.</p>
            <p>Next night (<hi>Diana</hi> running cheerfully through her Zodiac) wee rode eighteene long miles to <hi>Gezz</hi> a pretty Lodge belonging to the King: the greater part of this nights journey was through the bottoms of tranſected <hi>Taurus,</hi> whoſe ſtupendious forehead wets it ſelfe in the ayery middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: the fretum or lane is abut forty yards broad, even below, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrew'd with pibbles; either ſide is wall'd with an amazing hill, higher than to reach up at twice ſhooting, and for eight miles ſo continues, agreeing with the relation <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> make of it: a prodigious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, whether by Art or Nature queſtionable: I allude it unto Nature (Gods hand-maid.) But if it bee the ſame which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Caſpiae portae; Bertius, Caſpiarum Clauſtra; Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy, Pilae Caſpiae, Mediae vel Zagriae;</hi> and <hi>Zarzaeae</hi> by <hi>Dio. Siculus;</hi> I then grant <hi>Semyramys</hi> (who did what ſhe could to eternize her name) effected it, and from her was call'd <hi>Pilae Semyramidae,</hi> as <hi>Niger</hi> has it. Howbeit, the Perſians appropriate it to <hi>Mortys-Ally;</hi> who with his ſlicing Shamſheer for the eaſe of his people made it; a ſword after their Cabala a hundred cubits long; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with at one blow he beheaded ten (or as ſome ſay, a hundred) thouſand Chriſtians: of no credit, in that <hi>Pliny</hi> (ere <hi>Mortis-Ally</hi> was horne) thus writes of it, <hi>Ruptura eſt Montis longitudine octo mill: paſſ: anguſtiſsima,</hi> &amp;c. But though they ratifie their ſtory of <hi>Ally</hi> with an oath, from mee they get no other beliefe concerning it than this. <hi>Hanc fabulam longi temporis mendacia finxit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of more certainty is this, a Perſian in our company told me. That a dozen yeeres ago, a valiant thiefe with five hundred horſe and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Muſquets defended this narrow roade againſt all paſſengers; none paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nor re-paſſing without Tribute. The King of <hi>Larry-Ioon,</hi> and other mountaneers frown'd at his ſawſineſſe, and threatned his baniſhment; but ſuch ſtormes made good muſick to his eares: <hi>Abbas</hi> growes cholerick to bee ſo bearded by an ordinary fellow, and ſcornes to honour his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw by an Army: for knowing he had many Cavalleers about him, he doubted not by their courages to fetter him: he moves it and propoſes a reward: but they had heard the thiefe was of incomparable fortitude and dexterity; ſo as by long ſilence <hi>Abbas</hi> findes their feare, and grows pale at it: yet ere hee could give his rage a vent, a bold Armenian under-takes it: the King embraces him, and breaths freſh courage into the hardy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who excellently mounted, ſingles out the gladded thiefe, that doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to maſter ſo faire a beaſt with ſmall oppoſall. It was his cuſtome to give good play; uſually commanding his company to look on, if one or leſſe than five entred the ſtrait; ſuch high confidence had he in his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and dexterity; in ſhort ſpace they met, but parlee in <hi>Mars</hi> his language; the Armenian (in all points fitted for a ſterne encounter) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his blowes with ſuch skill and fury, that after long fight and much bloodſhed on either party, upon cloſe hee made death a paſſage: a victory ſo irkſome to his men (whoſe lives depended on his ſafety) that like robd Beares they fell upon the victor Armenian, who had doubtleſſe there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, had not an Ambuſh of many brave Cooſel-baſhaes broke out and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20354:89"/>
relieved him; by whoſe ſudden aſſault the wretched theeves were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifiz'd unto their Maſter. The Chriſtian returnes to Court crown'd with a glorious Laurell. <hi>Abbas</hi> addes to his luſtre and gives him a brave command, ſo inſupportable to the weak ſoule of this too-ſtrong Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, that to content the King and ground his ſtanding, he renyeſ his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, though an Ocean of teares ſhed by his beloved countrymen ſought to waſt him from the Alcoran. But ſee the end of ſuch Apoſtacy. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the King had cauſe to hug him in his boſome, ſo excellent and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prov'd he againſt the Tartarrs; yet jealoſie (rather divine vengeance) ſo ſtung old <hi>Abbas</hi> that without any triall or acquainting any man with his reaſon, hee commands <hi>Lolla-beg</hi> to cut his head off, ſuch time as hee was ſinging a lullaby to his good fortune.</p>
            <p>Our next nights manzeil was at <hi>Halvary</hi> (eighteene miles from <hi>Gezz</hi>) a well built Towne it is, and pleaſantly ſeated, the earth being mellowed by a ſweet rivolet, that purls from the tops of <hi>Taurus,</hi> from whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the ground is richly appareld in greene, and requites the painfull huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman with a happy acknoledgement of Olives, Walnuts, Rice, Wheat, and Wood in great abundance: bidding a ſad farewell to that healthy Village, the next night we rode 20 miles to <hi>Periſcow i.e.</hi> a broken Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: a Town ſomtimes honoured with the Kings reſidence; not that the beauty of his houſe (but ordinary) allures him, choyſe hawking, Pheſants and other game more delighting him here than any other part of <hi>Parthia.</hi> The Pole is here elevated ſix and thirty degrees: the Towne is refreſht with chryſtallin water, ſweet and advantagious to the earth and her inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants: tis built upon the brow of a high (well woodded) divided hill, whoſe top has beene crown'd with a vaſt Caſtle, but now by age or warre (the canckerwormes of all temporaries) is moath-eaten, her ribbs onely appeare, expreſſing deſolation and famine. One <hi>Mahummed</hi> commands the Towne, and keepes the ſword and skale, but is I feare dame <hi>Aſtreas</hi> corrupted ſervant: no marvell if in a diſcontented humour ſhee has left the earth, in <hi>Perſia</hi> (eſpecially in <hi>Periſcow</hi>) Juſtice is ſo odly ballanced. At our entrance into this Towne, (to extort a bribe from the Ambaſſador) he hangd one Perſian, cut off anothers noſe, and mutilated a third man, to ſhew his authority more than otherwiſe; their fault was, for ſtealing a trifle of two ſhillings value from a footman ſerving the Engliſh Agent: another was ready to bee truſt up, but a meſſage was ſent to my Lord Ambaſſador, that if hee pleas'd to beg his life it ſhould be granted him: my Lord Ambaſſador very gladly ranſom'd him with ſomewhat more than a meere complement. Complaint was alſo made againſt a Farmour for thraſhing a whore againſt her will; Monſieur <hi>Radamanth</hi> bids geld him, and to hang his ſtones at her eares as two pendants, the gulph of <hi>Perſia</hi> afforded none ſo pretious: the poore wrench humbly beſeecht him to ſpare his uſefull parts, ſo did his aſtoniſht wife, ſo as after much medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of friends and thirty pounds fyne, upon promiſe to grinde in his owne mill ever after, all is huſht, and each part ſatisfied. But each man cried out, a ſevere Cenſor is this <hi>Daraguod.</hi> I read that the barbarous Gaules had ſuch a cuſtome, <hi>ſi furaverit quod valet</hi> 40 <hi>denar. aut moecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur, vel caſtretur &amp;c.</hi> But here many times they have ſuch tricks

            <p>After two dayes repoſe in <hi>Periſcow,</hi> we jogd on; the Court then being little more than a hundred miles from us. Our firſt nights journey from <hi>Periſcow,</hi> was to <hi>Gheer,</hi> foure and twenty long miles, and tedious: ſome part was over terrible hills, other part through whiſtling dales; in both which we were ſo weather-beaten with a raging ſtorme of wind and haile bred in <hi>Tartary,</hi> and forc't over the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea (which from hence if the ſeaſon had permitted wee might have ſeene) that it not onely tooke away our ſight and hearing, but threatned our braines; for in deſpight of our beſt skill and cloſing one with another, it ſeparated us; inſomuch as we had hardly recovered our companies, had not the melodious noyſe of the braying Mules, and jingling of the Cammells bells revoked, yea untwiſted us out of theſe <hi>Caſpian</hi> or <hi>Zagrian</hi> ſtraits; through which, when neither Sunne, nor Moone, nor Starre befriends, whoſoever hereafter travell, let them (if they would prevent precipitious falls) borrow <hi>Theſeus</hi> his thred, or be content to wander in endleſſe labyrinths. From <hi>Gheer</hi> wee rode next night foure and twenty miles, to a ſmall Village whoſe name I have infortunatly loſt: the Frogs (the Bul-bulls or Philomels of this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh place) it may be were the cauſers of it, aſſembled in ſuch troopes, and chirping ſuch lothſome tunes, that we wiſht <hi>Iupiter</hi> had been to give them another King: for

To <hi>Aliavarr,</hi> one and twenty miles from the Town of Frogs we rode next night: a very ſweet and pleaſant place in water, wood, and ſtore of Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants; a bird in theſe Hyrcanian Towns, and neere the river <hi>Phaſis</hi> in <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grellya</hi> (<hi>Cholcos</hi> of old) originally breeding: <hi>Iaſon</hi> and his Argonauts firſt made them knowne to Greece, when hence he forc't their Sheep, bearing fleeces of gold, or gold-meriting fleeces. Next night we got to <hi>Necaw,</hi> five and twenty miles from <hi>Alliavar,</hi> obſervable in the Kings houſe, and that the common Manſions and Churches here, differ not in ſhape from ours of the poorer ſort in <hi>England.</hi> Next night wee got into <hi>Aſharaff;</hi> a Citie upon the <hi>Mare Caſpium.</hi> The Emperour of <hi>Perſia</hi> was here, and had long expected the Ambaſſadour; unwilling to remove hence, till he came, that he might ſee the extent of his Empire, and leſt wee ſhould report in <hi>Europe</hi> that there was no graſſe (nor grace) in <hi>Perſia.</hi> The Sultan of the Towne and fifty Coſelbaſhaes brought us into <hi>Aſharaff,</hi> and uſher'd us to our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I may ſay us, for the ceremony befitted not ſo great a perſon as an Ambaſſador.</p>

               <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi>) is 2 long miles from the Caſpian Sea. It is ſeated low, and many ſalt Mariſhes circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve her; is but meanly watered; no other but a ſmall ſpring trickling
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20354:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the Tauriſian Mountains drils in two branches thorow it, the broader of which is not five yards over. The ground is reaſonable fat, but inculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated: the greater part of her Inhabitants ploughing in <hi>campo martio.</hi> I judge two thouſand Families live in this Towne, and no doubt encreaſes daily, the King having but of late affected this place, his Pallace but newly finiſhed, and <hi>Farrabant</hi> the Hyrcan Metropolis but five miles Weſt remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hence, where the ſeat Royall has beene kept for many Ages. <hi>Abaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut</hi> alſo, two miles hence, ſurpaſſes for a curious Summer houſe, excells all his other houſes for a delicate view, Imagery, Hummum, Water-works, and a Forreſt ſtored with game of all ſorts: it I ſay, attracts the King, who (where ever hee ſtayes long) makes great Cities of ſmall Villages. The Buzzar here is but ordinarie; the Moſques are not to be admired, the Kings Pallace is vaſt, and notable only in her Gardens: the building itſelfe is confuſedly divided into three or foure Mohols or banquetting houſes, great and gorgeouſly painted; which, were they united might better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the eye, and cauſe the Architect to be commended. I will ſpeak more of it at the Ambaſſadors audience.</p>
            <p>The pole Artick is here elevated eight and thirty degrees, ſeventeene minutes; it is due North from <hi>Spahawn,</hi> as wee obſerved in our ſtar-light travell, (for the dayes are raging hot, and not to be travell'd in or jeaſted with) <hi>Arcturus</hi> was ever juſt before us: from <hi>Ormus</hi> to this place are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Engliſh miles: from <hi>Spahawn,</hi> three hundred and fifty, or there-abouts; as reckoned.</p>

After foure dayes reſt, the King (or Emperour, Potſhaw they call him) was pleas'd, without long warning to aſſigne him his day of audience. It was the five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of May, our Sabbath, and the fag-end of their Ramazen or Lent; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Pot-ſhaugh, for it ſpared him the charge of a royall Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. My Lord Ambaſſadour had Sir <hi>Sobert Sherley</hi> in his company, and ſeven or eight other Engliſh Gentlemen, his followers: good reaſon it was ſome Sultan or other ſhould have convoy'd and ſhewed him the way; (the Court being a quarter of a mile diſtant from our houſe) but it ſeemes they wanted breeding, or, that ſome other myſterie was in it: for, no other than a footman from <hi>Mahomet-Ally-beg</hi> proffer'd a complement, every way ſo courſe that the Ambaſſador had no patience to digeſt it, ſave by equall contempt to inculcate in the Perſian mode, and ſend him thankleſſe back againe. To the Court at length wee got, no noiſe, no admirers, ſaw wee there neither; by which we preſumed, the Towne knew not of our going thither, which I wonder at, ſince <hi>Abbas</hi> of all ſorts of honours counted to have ſtrangers at his Court, the higheſt. At our alighting, an ordinarie Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer bad us <hi>Hoſh-galdom</hi> and uſher'd us into a little Court <hi>du guard,</hi> that ſtood in the center of a ſpatious Court: in it was no other furniture ſave a few Perſian Carpets ſpread about a pretty white marble Tanck or Pond fill'd with water: here we all ſtayed, and for two houres ſpace junketted upon <hi>Pelo</hi> and wine, nothing ſo good in taſte as the materiall they were ſerved in, the flaggons, cups, diſhes, plates and covers, being of pure beaten gold; thence, wee were led by many Sultans, thorow a ſpatious and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant

Garden which was curious to the eye, and delicate to the ſmell; to another Summer houſe, rich in gold imboſments and painting; but farre more excellent in a free and royall proſpect; for from the Tarraſſes wee viewed the Caſpian Sea one way, and another way the tops of <hi>Taurus.</hi> The ground chambers were large, quadrangular, archt and richly guilded above and ont her ſides; below, ſpread with moſt valuable Carpets of ſilk and gold: in center were Tancks full of cryſtallin water (an element of no meane account in theſe torrid habitations;) round about the Tancks were placed (<hi>pomparum fercula</hi>) Goblets, Flagons, Ceſternes, and other Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of pure maſſie gold, ſome of which were fill'd with Perfumes, other ſome with Roſewater, with Wine ſome, and others with choiſeſt flowers: and after wee had reſted ſo long as wee might at full feed our hungry eyes with that food of oſtentation, wee were brought thence into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſquare large upper Chamber, where the roofe was formed into an Artificiall Element, many golden Planets attracting the wandring eye to help their motion. The ground was cover'd with richer Carpets than the other were, the Tanck was larger, the materia more rich in Iaſpar, and porphyr; the ſilver purling ſtreame was forced up into another Region, yet ſeem'd to bubble wantonly here as in her proper center: this ſea of rich ſtone, ſo deepe and ſo capatious ſeem'd an Ocean rather, where the ſpoiles of ſhipwracks were conjur'd out to pleaſe the appetite of Mydas or god Mammon: ſo much gold, in veſſels, for uſe and oſtentation, being ſet for us to looke upon, that ſome Merchants there, adjudg'd it worth twenty millions of pounds ſterlin: another watery Magazeen there was, circled with a wall of gold and richeſt Iemms: no flagons, cups, nor other there, but what were very thick and cover'd with Rubies, Diamonds, Pearles, Emralds, Turquoiſes, Iacinths, &amp;c. The Chamber was gallery wiſe, the ſeeling garniſht with Poetique fancies, gold, and choiſeſt colours; all which ſeem'd to ſtrive whether Art or Nature ſhould be to a judicious eye more valuable: one <hi>Iohn</hi> a Dutchman, who had long ſerv'd the King celebrated his skill, to the aſtoniſhment of the Perſians and his owne advantage: the ground in this roome alſo was over-layd with ſuch Carpets as befitted the Monarch of <hi>Perſia:</hi> round all the roome were placed tacite Mirzaes, Chawns, Sultans, and Beglerbegs, above threeſcore; who like ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate Statues ſat croſſe-legg'd; and joyned their bumms to the ground, their backs to the wall, their eyes to a conſtant object; not daring to ſpeak one to another, ſneeze, cough, ſpet, or the like, it being held in the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws preſence a ſinne of too great preſumption; In breach of any them fearing his ſpleen, who (as <hi>Caeſar</hi> told <hi>Metellus</hi>) could by the fulgur of his eye dart them dead, ſooner then ſpeak the word to have them killed: the Ganimed Boyes in veſts of gold, rich beſpangled Turbants and choiſe ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls, their curl'd haires dangling about their ſhoulders, rolling eyes, and vermillion cheeks, with Flagons of moſt glorious mettall, went up and downe, and proffered the delight of Bacchus to ſuch would reliſh it. At the upper end (and ſurmounting the reſt, ſo much as two or three white ſilken ſhags would elevate) ſat the Pot-ſhaw or Emperor of Perſia, <hi>Abbas;</hi> more belov'd at home, more famous abroad, more formidable to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than any of his prediceſſours. His Grandeur was this, (circled with

ſuch a world of wealth) to cloath himſelfe that day in a plaine red callico coat quilted with cotten: as if he ſhould have ſaid, we might ſee his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſted in his parts and prudence, not <hi>(furtivis coloribus)</hi> to ſteale re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect by borrowed colours or rich embroderies: croſſe-leg'd hee ſat: his Shaſh or Turbant was white and bungie; his waiſt was girded with a thong of leather, the ſcaberd of his ſword was red, the hilt of gold, the blade for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med like a hemi-cicle, and doubtleſſe well tempered: the Courtiers <hi>(Regis ad exemplum)</hi> were but ordinarily attired. My Lord Ambaſſador by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretor (or <hi>Callimachee</hi> as the Perſians name it) quickly acquainted <hi>Shaw Abbas</hi> why hee had undertaken ſo great a journey; to congratulate his good ſucceſſe againſt the common enemy of Chriſtendome, the Turk; to agrandize the traffick of raw ſilke, and other Perſian ſtaple merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes; to ſee Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> purge his honour from thoſe ſcandalous imputations <hi>Nogdi-Ally-beg</hi> his late Ambaſſador had blemiſht him with; and, that perpetuall amity might be continued 'twixt the two famous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narks of <hi>Great Brittayn</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Pot-ſhaugh</hi> roſe up; and in the Turkiſh Tongue gave him a gratious anſwer. To the firſt, that the Turks were a baſe people compared with the generous minds and vertue of the Perſians; in fifteene battells he had given them ample proofe of their magnanimity, and that no people in the world were to him ſo odious and offenſive. He wiſht unity amongſt all Chriſtian Princes, the Ottomans grounding their conqueſts meerely from their diſcord: which if otherwiſe, they would readily retreat to <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Concerning Trade, the King of <hi>Great Brittayn,</hi> ſhould if he ſo pleaſd have yearely ten thouſand bales of ſilk delivered him at <hi>Ormus</hi> every Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and for payment would accept of ſo many thouſand Clothes as would equall in value his raw ſilks; which as he knew the ſilk was a farre greater quantity then he could uſe in his owne Dominions, ſo were the clothes to him; but he would hazard the venting them by his Merchants, to ſerve the Tartars, Arabs, Georgians, and Muſcovians. And by this, neither we nor he ſhould have any need to traffique or correſpond with <hi>Turkie.</hi> It would infinitely redound to his honour and content; for hereby he ſhoul'd diſappoynt the grand Seignior of his yearly cuſtomes which he is forct to pay, when his carravans go to <hi>Aleppo</hi> or other parts of <hi>Turkie</hi> to deliver the ſilk, to the Venetian, Genoan, French, or other European Merchants; and an unexpreſſable torment and vexation to his heart and ſoule it muſt needs be, to ſee the whole band of <hi>Ianizaryes</hi> maintained meerly out of thoſe his cuſtomes. What was this? but to cheriſh thorns to prick his eyes, or to make the ſwords of his inveterate Enemies ſharp and fitted for his deſtruction. Concerning <hi>Sherley</hi> he had been long of his acquaintance and done more for him, than any of his native ſubjects; that if <hi>Nog-dibeg</hi> had layd aſperſions unjuſtly on him, he ſhould have decent ſatisfaction. It argued indeed <hi>Nogdibeg</hi> was guilty of ſome heynous cryme, in that he rather chooſe to kill himſelfe, than ſtand to his purgation from ſo impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall a Juſtice: in ſome ſort he preſag'd my rigor, for if he had come, by my head (an oath of no ſmall force) I had cut him in as many peeces as there are dayes in a yeare, and burnt them in the open market with ſtinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dogs turds. But touching a perpetuall league of true friendſhip, with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20354:91"/>
the Monarch of <hi>Great Brittayne</hi> your Maſter, I embrace it moſt heartily and wiſh them accurſt that go about to eclipſe it. And you are truly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (ſpeaking to my Lord Ambaſſador) that have done me that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, none of my famous Prediceſſors ever had before me: for as you are the firſt Ambaſſador ever came hither out of your Nation, ſo I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count your Maſter the firſt of the worſhippers of Ieſus, and of you in a higher reſpect than any other Ambaſſadors: which ſaid, <hi>Abbas</hi> ſat downe againe. And whereas all Mahomitans ſizeda, or knock their heads againſt the ground and kiſſe his foot or garment; moſt friendly he puld our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador downe, ſeated him cloſe to his ſide, ſmiling to ſee he could not ſitt (after the Aſiatique ſort) croſſe-legd: and calling for a bowle of Wine, drunk his Maſters health, at which the Ambaſſador uncoverd his head; and to complement beyond all expectation, the <hi>Pot-ſhaugh</hi> puld of his Turbant; by diſcovering his bald head ſymbolizing his Affection: and after an houres merriment departed. But by what meanes the current of the Kings good will became diverted afterwards I cannot divine. I could afterwards perceive that Mahomitan Princes are terrible crafty or myſteriouſly politicious: for from that day till we got <hi>Cazbyn,</hi> neither was our Ambaſſador feaſted at Court, neither ſaw he the King, nor did any other Sultan invite, or come to viſite him: we partly found the cauſe, <hi>Mahomet-Allybeg</hi> was by bribery made our enemy; a Perſian lately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc't from a baſe beginning, and for his neat faculty in diving into all mens doings, acquainting the <hi>Potſhaw</hi> who grumble, who are contented; by ſuch his paraſitick facetiouſneſſe has ingroſt his favour from all others, inſomuch as all things paſſe through this impure conveighance; for whom he loves the King honours, ſuch as he hates the King cruſhes all to peeces. So that to have his good opinion, each great man out-vies others by guifts and ſuch lincks of corrupt eſteeme, inſomuch that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall commings in, are bruited ſevenſcore thouſand pounds ſterling. And well may be, ſince <hi>Myter-beg</hi> (the overſeer of the Kings Harams or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralios) has a hundred thouſand pound yearly, if it be true, ſome here aſſured me. <hi>Sors noſtra humilior!</hi> poore <hi>Tamer-begs</hi> houſe at the North end of the Towne impriſond us twelve long dayes and nights, (ſo long the Court ſtayd, after we got thither;) where the Sunne darted his outragious beames ſo full upon us, that no part of the burning Zone could broile more than did <hi>Aſharaffe</hi> at that preſent: but the Sunne did not more torment us all the day time, than thoſe innumerable ſwarmes of Gnats, Mus-ke-toes, and ſuch like excrements, ſtung and peſterd us each night; they biting us, we thraſhing them like mad folks. Notwithſtanding, ſome better uſe I deſire to make of this time, than in ſpider-catching: and in the firſt place commemorate we the Kings juſtice, (Tiranny I may rather call it) for which, he is famouſed above all other Mahomitan Emperors: that by view of others miſeries, ours may appeare but reall flea-bitings.</p>

be more commendable in Princes than Juſtice, (for it is that that makes them gods) yet clemency is no leſſe honourable. <hi>Tully</hi> a heathen could affirme it, in his oration to <hi>Caeſar</hi> for the life of <hi>Lygarius:</hi> Thy cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency (O <hi>Caeſar</hi>) is moſt excellent, yea more honourable than thy other vertues: Fortune hath made thee great, Nature advanc't thee higher in thy inclination unto mercy. Nor can they well bee ſeparated. A Prince (exalted above others in dignity and Title) is tyed to an impartiall way, neither hating nor fearing any, but rewarding and puniſhing as cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; without which, contempt or confuſion followeth. But to theſe of <hi>Abbas</hi> I cannot give the glorious Attribute of Juſtice: ſince, if the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment exceed the fault, it then degenerates into cruelty: a vice, odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God, (the Father and fountaine of mercy:) to men, by imitating their deformities; conceiting any Act, though never ſo unnaturall (if moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded after ſuch a pattern) good and commendable.

               <hi>Abbas,</hi> by divers Paramours had divers children; many of which hee educated with great coſt, care, and experience. Of moſt hope, fame, and vertue; where <hi>Iſmael, Sophy-mirza, Codobanda-Sultan,</hi> and <hi>Emangoly;</hi> foure brave young Princes; the two firſt, begot on <hi>Gordina</hi> daughter of <hi>Simon-cawn;</hi> the later two, of <hi>Martha</hi> daughter of <hi>Scander-mirza:</hi> both Georgians, both Chriſtians: the firſt Lady was brought thence by <hi>Kurchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki-cawn;</hi> the other by <hi>Shaw-Tamas-Coolibeg;</hi> both Perſians, both favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: all of them ſo deare to <hi>Abbas,</hi> that it ſeemed hee then had got the Elixar of earthly happineſſe: his wives were ſo incomparably beautifull; his favorites ſo exactly faithfull; his ſonnes ſo lively the characters of his perſon, policy and courage: reciprocally joying the aged King, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the warlike Perſians. But it is commonly obſerved that as the moſt excellent things fade, periſh, and alter ſooneſt: ſo this admirable candor and perfection in theſe youthfull Princes quickly vaniſhed, <hi>Saturn</hi> acting it. <hi>Iſmael</hi> (when by reaſon of his innate delight in Armes and many quick ſignes of magnanimity, the Aſiatick world gazed and admired him) in a black infernall cloud of poyſon went down to an untimely grave at nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, in the Meridian of his ſplendor. <hi>Soffy-mirza,</hi> dogd by a like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe deſtiny, though elevated at firſt for revealing a conſpiracy, was in the end, at equall yeeres throwne downe and cruſht to death, after the dumb <hi>Capigi</hi> had got a hatefull victory, meere jealoſie in the King commanding it. <hi>Emanguly,</hi> ere his popular applauſe could hatch his ruine, upon confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with a witch that hee ſaw (by the Almuten of his nativity) ſhort life attended him, growes fearfull of his Syres inconſtancy, and in a deep
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20354:93"/>
diſconſolate melancholy evaporates his ſad ſpirits, leaving the expectation of hazard and ſoveraignty to <hi>Codobanda Sultan,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Soffee,</hi> who (made wiſe by his brothers miſeries) ſo exquiſitly behaved himſelfe, in duty to his King, in a pleaſing diſtance to the people; that <hi>Abbas</hi> doates, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple celebrate, and an uncontroulable good Fortune ſeemes to dandle him, Affability, bounty, loyalty, courage, and experience in Armes, at home, abroad, the Perſian Monarchy, Turk, Arab, Mogul, and Tartar, admiring, fearing, and commending him in ſeverall Eulogies and acclamations: his owne, left nothing unſaid or uninvented that might honour him; his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without giving their thoughts the lye, could not but idolize him: who for all that, (not like our common ſpirits, efflated by every vulgar breath, upon every act, deifie themſelves, and conceit all great addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of honour under their merits) ſtood immovable, ſorry he grew ſo popular; modeſtly chiding them for flattery, condemned himſelfe of hypocriſy by ſuffring his victories to bee ſo guilded, ſince what he had or did was but a reflex of his Fathers vertue, which he doubted might ſuffer an eclipſe by his accumulations. Oh! how execrable is this marrow fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſcab of jealouſie and envie? it converts that reaſon which only makes us Men, without any regard of juſtice, into brutiſhneſſe; yea to exceed in cruelty the moſt unreaſonable, moſt violent creatures! Is not <hi>Abbas</hi> a King, a Father? does clemency belong to any attribute ſo properly? Is not <hi>Soffee-Sultan-mirza</hi> a Prince, his ſonne? on whom can he more juſtly conferre his love? in whom ſhould vertue rather dwell? where can there be a better center? poore Prince! the path he treads to adde luſtre to his Fathers Diadem, to do his Country good, to be accounted commendable; betrayes his ſteps, and intices him to an affrighting precipice: the more he labours to delight his Father, it ſerves as fuell to an unjuſt jealouſie; the more hee dignifies his countries honour, the more applauſe the people crowne him with; and <hi>Abbas</hi> feares his popularity: yea ſo farre cheriſhes diſhonourable thoughts, ſo much degenerates from paternall piety, that without all pitty or regard of juſtice (which makes Kings more beautifull and glorious than when circled with a Tyrants ſparkling Diadem) hee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates his ſpeedy deſtruction. During theſe his cabinet machinations, the harmeleſſe Prince brandiſhes his ſteele in proud <hi>Arabia,</hi> but after many conqueſts, himſelfe becomes captivated. An Arabian Princeſſe of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, great beauty (in ſuch bodies uſually are impaled the faireſt ſoules) and other excellent indowments fettered him: but by his bravery and worth quickly redeem'd himſelfe and vanquiſht her. Such magick has love, ſuch magnetick power is in vertue. By this Lady he had (in few yeeres) two children, <hi>Soffy</hi> and <hi>Fatyma:</hi> no leſſe loved by their Syre, than beloved, doated on by the Grandſyre <hi>Abbas;</hi> a ſtrange affection, to diſtinguish ſo unnaturally; to ſeparate where nature had ſo ſtrongly joyned, to hate the graft, and have the fruit endeared to him. But that his hate might flow more currantly and leſſe ſuſpected, hee lookes one way and ſhoots ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſeekes to inrage by abuſing him hee lov'd moſt dearly, <hi>Magar</hi> an <hi>Arab,</hi> the Princes Tutor, a ſober, faithfull, and valiant ſervant. <hi>Abbas</hi> calls for him, and in leiu of applauſe or rewarding him for his ſonnes noble education, he lends him a ſterne frowne, accuſes him of pride, and charges
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20354:93"/>
him that hee had bewitcht the Prince with baſe ambition. <hi>Magar</hi> ſees not the venome prepared for him; and therefore in an humble, but confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excuſe, ſeekes to quiet him; but the better hee apologuiz'd in his owne behalfe, and the clearer hee made the Mirzaes loyalty appeare, the more hee exaſperates the King, the higher his rage inflamed: ſo that firſt hee amazes him with a volley of rigorous defamations, and in that maze gives the ſigne, a dreadfull ſigne: for forthwith the Capigies break out and ſtrangle him. An unparaleld barbariſme! an act ſo unbeſeeming that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous King, as amongſt the common ſort to this day it is not credited: but, Fames brazen ſhrill-mouth'd Trump ſounds it abroad, and ere long the Prince (then in action againſt the Tartar) has notice of his Syres injuſtice: hee leaves the Camp, and after many ſignalls of ſorrow, beſeeches the King hee may know the reaſon of it: who flaſhes him this thundring rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for thy rebellion; he calls heaven to witneſſe his integrity and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but <hi>Abbas</hi> provokes him further, to intrap and have ſome colour to ſatisfie the world in his deſtruction. The Prince madded with heat and paſſion, imagines hee ſaw <hi>Magar</hi> a ſtrangling; and in that extaſie unſheaths his ſword, vowing to reſcue him: the King ſorrowes not at his diſtraction, but at this advantage (upon ſome faire termes diſarming him) calls him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another roome, and (pretending he was not very well) goes out, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ſeven big-bon'd villanies, deafe and dumbe, through a trap doore to iſſue upon him, arm'd with bloody minds and deadly bow-ſtrings: their habit and weapons bewray their cruelty, they needed no other interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: the Prince admires the cauſe, and if oratory or other ſubmiſſive ſignes of entreaty could have gotten remorſe or delay from theſe hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, but till he knew the ground of this unnaturall project, he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded it: but, aſſured they were inexorable, with an incomparable rage and ſuddenneſſe he flies upon them, now one, then another receiving ſuch horrid blowes, that (ere they could faſten on him, or inſnare him with their ghaſtly twanging bowſtrings) hee ſent three of them to the Divell; and long time defended himſelfe, offending thoſe blood-hounds with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable courage and dexterity, inſomuch that had hee maſtered any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, hee had doubtleſſe ſaved himſelfe; but wanting it, his breath failed, and longer his valour could not nouriſh him, for, <hi>facile eſt vincere non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnantem:</hi> ſo that at laſt thay faſtened their noozes on him, who now was as a dead man; for all which, the villains had triumpht in his further tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, had not the King prevented it, commanding them to pinnion him, and (before hee could recover his ſences) to draw a flaming ſteele afore his eyes, and ſo to blind him; forbidding him the ſight of what hee loved ever after; wife, babes, friends, ſoldiers, or <hi>Magars</hi> carcaſſe: And by this impiety, <hi>Aſia</hi> loſt her faireſt jewell, <hi>Perſia</hi> her Crown of honour, and <hi>Mars</hi> his darling.</p>
            <p>The loſſe of ſo brave a Prince is quickly rumord: All <hi>Perſia</hi> mourns, and in many threnodies ſing his farewell: his Army ſwells with paſſion, but ſeeing no remedy, by a forced ſilence murmur their imprecations: the Prince, when he perceived his undoing (the eye of reaſon lent him ſuch a ſight) falls frantick; hee curſes his birth, his fame, his loyalty, his cruell parent; and by many contumatious threats, vowes his deſtruction: but
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20354:94"/>
               <hi>vana ſine viribus ira;</hi> he findes his revenge impoſſible; but at that conceit roares hidiouſly, and is not to be comforted, till <hi>Suliman-mirza, Curchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki-cawn</hi> and other his kinſmen and quondam favorits, flockt about him, and by their miſerable examples dictated patience; for none there but in ſome meaſure had ſwolne big with the Kings infuſion in their times, and by like jealouſie were cruſht downe, mutilated, and damnd to perpetuall impriſonment. In thoſe diſcontented times, <hi>Abbas</hi> kept his Orb, moving like another <hi>Saturn:</hi> now he imagines his Crowne fixt cloſely to his head, his ſeat ſteddy, every way free from ſtormes and other accidentall cauſes that might diſturb his quiet: he ſwum hourely in an ocean of delight, and reliſht it: but nothing ſo much inchanted him, as young <hi>Fatyma;</hi> no other Syren was melodious in ſong, or delicate in feature, ſave pretty <hi>Fatyma;</hi> if any ſtood in feare, he is pacified by <hi>Fatyma;</hi> Court and Kingdome admired his love, but joyed at it; for by this Lady they found a way to expell his rage, and how to pleaſure him; the priſoners alſo by this <hi>Fatyma</hi> got ſome livelyhood; for want of which, they were oft times welnigh famiſhed; none (but ſhee) daring to mediate: and thus by this good infant gained they what formerly they pined for, food and comfort. But what joy findes the blinded Prince, ſince hee cannot participate: revenge delights him more, that word as muſick pleaſes the infernall fancie of this melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Mirza,</hi> not caring how deteſtable, ſo <hi>Abbas</hi> ſuffered. The Divell inſpires new rage, and blowes the coales of (more than cruell) aſſaſſination: for albeit he loved <hi>Fatima,</hi> yet hearing how his Father doated on her, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets his hate, yea hatches the innocents confuſion. Oh! in him behold the ſavage and tranſcendent cruelty of curſed man: revenge had plung'd him headlong into a whirle-poole of unnaturall barbariſme; inſomuch, as when the pious child came (in an unluckie houre) to bring him comfort, and by all ſymptoms of duty to expatiate her obedience; the wretch graſpes her, &amp; in a lymphatick fury whirles her neck about, unable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſt her ſelfe from his ſtrong and wrathfull hands, miſerable <hi>Fatima</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring by her helliſh Father: and in her, the joy of parents, delight of <hi>Abbas,</hi> candor of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and comfort of the diſtreſſed, vaniſhing. The amazed Princeſſe his wife cries out his ſight deceived him, that it was <hi>Fatyma,</hi> little dreaming that he therefore martyr'd her, becauſe <hi>Fatyma.</hi> And, as if that had not beene enough, (to prevent the King of a ſucceſſor) hearing young <hi>Soffees</hi> voyce, dolorouſly crying out for <hi>Fatima,</hi> wingd with rage he gropes for him, but by the Princeſſes interpoſing, the boy eſcapt, or elſe had loſt (what he now victoriouſly enjoyes) the Monarchy of <hi>Perſia.</hi> When <hi>Abbas</hi> heard her Tragedy, he growes ſo outragiouſly paſſionate, that many feared he would become his owne executioner. But, when hee had drencht his ſorrow in a ſea of ſalt teares, hee moderates his ſpleen, and revives upon hopes of puniſhment, and vowes to retaliate him in the height of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but, receives ſo terrible a reply from the diſtracted Prince, who had return'd a million of diſmall curſes, that he is ſtupified with amazement: And to end the Cataſtrophe, after he had tyred out two dayes with much impatience, the third, hee put a period to his loathed life, by quaffing up a cup of deadly poyſon: the King ſhewing needleſſe mercy in his ſolemne buriall. The ſad Princeſſe mewed her ſelfe up from ſight of man; but ſince

her ſonnes comming to the Crowne, whether hee have made her ſociable or no I know not: <hi>Abbas</hi> dyed juſt at our departure.

Hyrcania</hi> is moſt part (a great part wee travelled) woody and champaign; watered with many ſweet and ſpatious (but not navigable) rivers; ſuch be <hi>Araxis,</hi> (deſcending ſayes <hi>Ptolomy</hi> from <hi>Sacapen</hi> or <hi>Sadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi>) <hi>Cyrus, Obſel, Connack, Mazaeras, Bundama, Hydero,</hi> (from the Deſarts of <hi>Lop</hi>) <hi>Aragus,</hi> (falſly ſaid to deſcend from the Moloſſians) and others, which from the Tauriſian Mountains ſtream violently, and after they have mellowed the humyd earth in many divided branches, wander into the <hi>Mare Caſpium:</hi> at this day it abounds with many ſorts of beaſts, birds, fruits, fiſh, and villages: Sheep, Buffoloes, Camells, Aſſes, Goats, Horſes, Cowes, Antilopes, red and fallow Deer; with Silkwormes alſo, and Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, Partrich, Quaile, Woodcock, Pellican, Heron, Pouts, Thruſh, Hens, Philomels; and in fruits of moſt ſorts; with fiſhes alſo, as Trowt, Pike, Carp, Sturgeon, Conger, Lamprey, Tuneys, Gudgeon, Thornback, Cockles, Oyſters, Muſſells, Crabs, Limpits, Dog-fiſh, and Cackrell; moſt of theſe the Caſpian ſea affoorded us: and (which we will ſequeſtere from others) with Lyons, Wolves, Wild-catts, Bores, Scorpions, and Tygers, ſuppoſed to nurſe the people, as ſung the Poet

Their habit reſembles the Iriſh troozes: upon their heads they weare Piramidall caps of cloth lined with delicate ſheeps wooll: the vulgar Hyrcanian take thus repreſented.</p>

               <hi>Hyrcania</hi> is a continued Forreſt, and of all the trees I ſaw, none excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Mulberies, for numberleſſe numbers, none more notable for uſe; ten, yea thirty miles ſpreading in them: the berries if white, refreſht our bellies, the colour our eyes, the leaves our obſervation. In every Village and Cottage wee might behold ſheds fild with induſtrious people, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching ſilk-worms, ſeaming the ſeminary of that valuable Fly, ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of through all the world, ſo advantageous to the Perſian Emperour; who from hence (beſides thoſe many rich Carpets of ſilk and gold, ſilk, ſilk and ſilver yeerely woven for their owne uſes) extracts an annuall quantity of raw ſilke, ſeven thouſand ſix hundred Batmans (or bales I think) expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through Turkie into Europe, to his great benefit. The ſilk-worme (as in quality, ſo in diverſity of ſhape) varies from other wormes: her firſt generation ariſing from a ſmall round black ſperme (like Gunpowder or Muſturd-ſeed) which by moderate heat increaſes to an inch, aſſuming (at firſt) the ſhape of a palmer worme, from which reſemblance in ſix months ſhe two times changes: her common food are leaves and boughs of trees; but of all other, the white Mulbery moſt delights her, ſtrewed dayly all over thier ſheds, kept ſweet, and warme, and cleanly. Having ſatiated their uſefull appetites, they forthwith become enemy to idleneſſe, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe their creeping, and with their excretiated vertue intwine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in ſome ſort making their lawne both winding-ſheet and Sepulcher. The ſilke co-operates with ſuch colours as be laid afore them, white, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, greene, and ſandy. And albeit they be involved, yet are they viſible to the eye, ſuch is the tranſparency of their excrement. Their exterior part, is a pale gold commixt with lemon, rough and hayry. The interior more hard and form ovated, the better to inhume th'included Fly. Whoſe task being ended, the ſilken cods or balls are ſtraightway ſpread afore

Apolloes corruſcant rayes, by whoſe radiant candor the diſtreſſed worme is broyld to death; not unlike a glorious miſer faelicitating his death, ſo it be in contemplation of his rich idolatry. And by this expanſion the ſilk becomes much finer and purer, than if ſhee were ſuffered from her owne notion to iſſue forth and break her habitacle: After this the ſilke cods are thrown into a large caldron, fild with water, and made meanly hot; then, with a penetrated cane the people ſtir the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about, at once drawing the ſlimy ſilke from as many as his inſtrument can lay hold upon, or convene in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; laſtly with a wheele they are turned round; it attracts the ſilk, and leaves (nothing worth the getting) indivellicated. But that they affoord hony, yeeld wax, build neſts, and are a ſort of ſpyder, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> may conjecture ſo, but experience derides their ſuppoſition. By this time we are got to <hi>Omoall</hi> a City as well known as any other in <hi>Mozendram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OMOALL, (of old, <hi>Zarama</hi> I imagin) is thought to bee that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borca</hi> or <hi>Naborea,</hi> where the Oracle of dreames was ſo much famouſed. It is built under the North ſide of the imperious Mountaine <hi>Taurus;</hi> of ſuch Grandeur, that three thouſand Families inhabit in her, of ſeverall countries and languages, Armenians, Georgeans, Hyrcans, Perſians, Jewes, Curdies, and Muſcovians, who make a Babel of ſeven tongues amongſt them. The place is fruitfull, and bleſt in preſent proſperity and antick greatneſſe, the ruines compleating the report of her being once Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis; the houſes at this day are not builded in the meaneſt faſhion, glorying above the reſt, in an old but ſtrong and ſtately Caſtle, ſecond to none about her; which, beſides the well compoſed Architecture (affoording no ſmall pleaſure to the eye) is obſervable in a deep trench fild with water, of good defence againſt the pilfering and rodomantadoes of the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tauriſians: commendable alſo in ſome ſweet gardens uſefull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable: within the Towne and neere the Caſtle, is a famous Moſque, honoured by foure hundred and foure and forty Princes and Prophets of that Kingdome intombed there, whoſe Sepulchers raiſe admiration in the beholders; that eſpecially of <hi>Meer Agowmadeen</hi> is famous, to whoſe ſhrine are daily offered ſerious devotion. As I entred, I found twenty reverent and well apparelled Arabians in a round, cloſe by the Princes Dormitory, with each an Arabic Alcoran before him; out of which, with great modeſty and good muſick they chanted a dolefull requiem to his ghoſt; in which they were ſo ſerious, that notwithſtanding I came ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt them, and in ſuch a habit as others admired, they ſung on and in a Dorick ſweetneſſe continued till they had finiſht that their Threno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; which ended, they aroſe and bad me heartily welcome, readily poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the rarities of their Temple. Thence, I went to the river ſide (over which upon a Bridge we rode the night before) hoping to ſhade my ſelfe (from outrageous Phaeton) under ſome Poplars there abounding; but quickly left the place againe: for 7 or eight beautious (but not baſhful) Damoſells (like ſo many Dorids) ſprung ſuddenly out from the water, to admire my cloaths, never regarding they were naked; ſome my hat, my hayre others, other-ſome thought my ſpurres an antick. I wondred no leſſe at their immodeſty, and left them with a frowne, dictating their baſe carriage and my impatience. And till by inquiry I ſaw it came from a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20354:97"/>
greedy novelty, I thought them Layeſians: but it ſeem'd I erred; for when the men (ſuch time as <hi>Phoebus</hi> mounts in his meridian) go to ſleep, the women then enjoy the river and coole their heat, in both kinds too much abounding there. Their habit is only a ſmock of tranſparent lawne, wrought at hands, neck, and skirt, with an imbroydery of ſilk and gold; the men are cloathed like the other Hyrcanians. From <hi>Omoall</hi> we travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Larry-Iohn</hi> or <hi>Ioon;</hi> (I cannot tell if that <hi>Ionaca</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>) thirty miles thence; at which place the Kingdome of <hi>Hyrcania</hi> takes end and Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> or <hi>Taur-achow</hi> beginning. <hi>Taurus</hi> (ſayes <hi>Dion.

            <p>Our journey lay ſometimes through inhoſpitable ſtraits, other times over moſt ſtupendious hills; the bredth from one ſide to another about fifty Engliſh miles, from <hi>Omoall</hi> to <hi>Damoan;</hi> the length fifteene hundred: towring in a hedge of hills from <hi>Armenia</hi> to the furtheſt part of <hi>Indya:</hi> and after two dayes painfull climbing got ſo high, that wee might ſee the middle region under us, and we involved in chill exhalations. <hi>Taurus, Mons omnium maximus,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> yet the ſublime height did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminate us, as did the danger of deſcending, the path was ſo uneven and craggy; yea, the rocks ſo unskilfully cut out for a paſſage; that great heed muſt be taken in the treading or a terrible precipice into a bottomleſſe lake indangers us; in one hill for three miles together the way was carved (by ſome unskilfull workman) in the mid-part of a moſt horrible aſpiring perpendicular Mountaine, the lane in ſome places a yard, in ſome but halfe a yard in breadth, ſo as if by accident two horſemen meet, I could not ſee how both could have ſafe paſſage, nor is it higher than ones head if mounted; a wretched paſſage! for whiles I was ſometimes looking at the wonderfull height above us, and anon caſting my ſight downwards into that dark Abiſſe, a rock bending ill-favoredly into the narrow way ſtruck me ſuch a blow, as for a great while I was aſtonied, and happily delivered from a downfall; a rock, demanding an uncivell tribute from all careleſſe paſſengers. At length wee got ſafe out of that formidable path of death into the broad and lofty Mountaines, from whence the lying Greekes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held <hi>Prometheus</hi> (ſonne of <hi>Iapeth</hi> by <hi>Aſia</hi> his wife and brother to <hi>Atlas</hi>) cheyned to theſe rocks, his heart gnawed by a Vultur, for daring (though <hi>Pallas</hi> helpt him up) to ſteale celeſtiall flames from <hi>Apollo's</hi> Chariot wheeles, to inſpire life into his Images.

            <p>But more uſefull to our intellect, is the long time famous'd Mountaine <hi>Albors,</hi> neere this place; infamous in the Pyree<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Temple of Idolatrous Fyre, which has never gone out for fifty Ages. <hi>Strabo</hi> in his fifteen and <hi>Procopius</hi> in his ſecond book of the warrs and jarrs in <hi>Perſia</hi> remember it: <hi>Ben-Ionas</hi> alſo, a vagabond Jew records it. Within the Fane (round and low) is an Altar elevated five ſteps from the ground: afore this Altar is a Trench or ditch, wherein the Fyre-god is placed; a fire not as is other elementall fire, fed by cumbuſtibles; but of that, <hi>Prometheus</hi> ſtole from <hi>Don-Phoebus</hi> Cart-wheeles, or which <hi>Zertooſt</hi> their Law-giver ſtole from heaven, (a cabala of equall truth, and chuſe you which likes you beſt) and is, no doubt in imitation of the Jewiſh fire which <hi>Moſes</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhould never bee extinguiſht or prophan'd, 6 <hi>Levit.</hi> 13, the Devill ever frameing his worſhip (to make it better accounted of) after the beſt patterne. In this Tophet, they commonly immolated their little children, and ſomtimes men of more yeers than diſcretion, thinking by this volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to purchaſe an (iron) crowne, of (helliſh) martyrdome. After he had vow'd himſelfe to bee a ſacrifice, his friends in great troopes, and with no leſſe joy flockt about him; clapping him on the ſhoulders with this greeting. Hayle, bleſſed man! When? when wilt thou burne thy impure carcaſſe, to have it purg'd &amp; made glorious in Paradize? he appoints a day, and they prepare towards the ceremony: the time being come, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble at his gate; &amp; he iſſues crown'd with garlands; they mount him upon a Mule, (for after hee has vow'd, hee muſt no more honour the profane earth with his foot-ſteps) the <hi>Ieſop</hi> annoints him with a hallowed oyle, and after many loving farewells, he incinerates in flame to aſhes. Ere his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren depart, or muſick ceaſe roaring, the Prieſt having conſulted with the Devill, tells them their duty; bids them ſanctifie themſelves, and provide a coſtly banquet againſt ſuch a day, when their fathers ghoſt means to viſit them: they leap for joy, and think each houre a day till the time accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhes. At laſt old Satan comes, that ſubtle lyar, and in their fathers ſhape or phantaſme, enters amongſt them, and at ſome diſtance deludes their eyes, and readily ſatisfies their curioſities; they inquire how Paradize con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents him; hee replies, by proſpect it is a garden of ſuch delights as are ineffable, but as yet cannot poſſeſſe it. They aske why? he tells them, becauſe his will is unperformed; they aske who he left it with, the Prieſt produces it: the tenor is of one note, his goods muſt be divided into three, the Altar one, the Prieſts another, his children a third: without which ſpell the ghoſt affrights them ever after. The Gowers in many parts of <hi>Perſia</hi> are of this religion; the Perſees alſo in <hi>Indya.</hi> Upon theſe Mountains they fable, that <hi>Piſchyton</hi> (<hi>Guztaſps</hi> eldeſt ſonne, who in <hi>Iacobs</hi> dayes govern'd <hi>Perſia</hi>) lives here and thirty Immorall Chyrons, who by a grant

of <hi>Zertooſt</hi> (the fire-bringer) are to abide here till Doomſday, and if any ſteale in by chance, they likewiſe may become immortall. No doubt, but <hi>Abbas</hi> attempted it. Here alſo, upon <hi>Quequits</hi> high hill are ſome reliques of the furious Gyanteſſe <hi>Lamaſaque,</hi> and of <hi>Arneoſt</hi> her husband, a Gyant of monſtrous ſhape and proportion: I have forgotten how many ſcore of cubits hee was high, but arm'd hee was (if you will beleeve the Perſians) with two hornes as big as the tusks of an Elephant; his eyes were terrible big, his taile like to a Cows, but in fight as powerfull as was that club of <hi>Hercules:</hi> This great theife and his wife were both ſlaine by Saint <hi>Ham-ſha Honcoir</hi> ſuch another ſouldier as was Saint <hi>Romayn</hi> at <hi>Rohan.</hi> But leaving theſe <hi>ignes fatui,</hi> let mee draw your eyes to our enſuing journeys: After many laborious ſteps wee got to a Village called <hi>Ryna,</hi> twelve miles ſhort of <hi>Damoan;</hi> where wee beheld a Caſtle, ſo built upon the beſt advantages of Art and Nature, that it ſeemes impregnable: above, it wants no ground fitted for eaſe and warre, ſweet gardens fild with fruits and flowers, made happy in a rivolet of pure water ſpringing there, and thence delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtreaming in many oblique meanders into the bottome.</p>
            <p>In this place, five and twenty yeere ago, lived one <hi>Meleck Bahaman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Late co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt of Mount-Taurus.</note> who like a ſecond <hi>Pluto</hi> commanded many hills and dales in <hi>Gelack</hi> and <hi>Taurus;</hi> a King, albeit confined to the middle region, moſt commonly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with great coſt and care to uphold his dignity againſt Tartar and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian his great coſt and quarrelſome neighbours: yet ſuch was his good fortune, policy, valour, and mutuall love twixt him and his ſubjects, that though often invaded, he ſtood ſecure, yea, lived to heare the ruine of many, his late enemies; his only aime tending to preſerve what his predeceſſors had juſtly made him heyre unto, and that his gray hayres might go in peace to an eternall dormitory. Thus thought <hi>Bahaman,</hi> and added his endeavors to compleat his thoughts. But <hi>Abbas</hi> the ambitious Perſian, returning from the conqueſt of <hi>Mozendram</hi> (forcing <hi>Shalley-mirza</hi> ſonne of King <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla-cawn</hi> to become his pentioner) looks up upon <hi>Taurus</hi> which ſeemed to threaten his undaunted heart, and vowes to bee no longer bearded by that mountanous King, taking his Motto out of <hi>Tacitus, id aequius quod va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidius;</hi> charging him alſo that from his lofty dwelling hee peered into his two Kingdomes <hi>Medya</hi> and <hi>Mozendram,</hi> by that advantage ranſacking his Townes, robbing his <hi>Carravans,</hi> illuring his wormes, anticipating his progreſſe to the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and diverting many rivers into other ſources; which ſpringing upon <hi>Taurus,</hi> ſtream'd gallantly into <hi>Hyrcania</hi> &amp; <hi>Shervan,</hi> without whoſe felicitating, thoſe Provinces became barren and barbarous. <hi>Meleck Bahaman</hi> readily anſwers <hi>Abbas,</hi> and finds his drift, comparing him to that fable of the Wolfe who drinking at the ſpring-head, quarrelled with the ſilly Lambe for troubling his draught by quenching his flagrant thirſt at the ſtream below. Whiles <hi>Abbas</hi> in an impatient delay reſolves to try the chance of war, appointing <hi>Methiculibeg</hi> with an army of Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel-baſhawes to perfect his deſignes, and not to deſcend thence without victory.</p>
            <p>It could not be ſo ſecretly intended, but aged <hi>Bahaman</hi> has intelligence of his immediate purpoſes. At firſt it troubled him, in that his gray haires were more propenſe to eaſe than tumult. Yet, leſt his ſubjects from his
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20354:100"/>
example might be diſcouraged, he throwes away his dull thoughts, and as a common father provides for ſafety, in armes and victualls furniſhing his large Cittadell for many yeares ſiege, yea, omitting nothing that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him a carefull and expert Souldier. In each defenſive place he plants a Garriſon, and makes every part naked and comfortleſſe where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie might march, that in nothing he might be advantagious to the Perſian. That done, he mews himſelfe, his Queene, two ſonnes, and ten thouſand able men in his defended Caſtle, not fearing any thing they could attempt againſt him. The Perſian generall with thirty thouſand men mount up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and at their firſt aſcent, find the way ſo tedious, made more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous by many diſmall ſhowres of Darts and ſtones thundering on them, that they grumbled at ſuch ſtratagems, and would needs tumble downe againe, till <hi>Methiculibeg</hi> by many promiſes of reward, and expoſing his owne head in the front of danger drew them up, and after ſome petty skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, incampt himſelfe before this Caſtle; where he was told, the King and victory was included. When they had long viewd this inacceſſible fortreſſe, they halfe diſpaired of ſubduing it. Such was the height of that Caſtle, and ſuch the perpendicular aſcent, two excellent defences Art and Nature had inricht it with. Some Attempts he made, invalidable; to ſhoot their Arrowes at it, was one with ayming at the Moone. Small ſhott they had and many Lances, but of ſmall force to batter rocks; ſo that after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tedious bravadoes (wherein the Perſian had ſtones for payment) the Generall, finding force not valuable, turnes Matchiavillian. He ſummons them above to parlee with him; which granted, he aſſaults them with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proteſtations of truce and friendſhip. And that hee might the better ſhadow truth, preſents the aged King with choiſe Tulipants, Shamſheers, Pearles, and other guilded baits, meane enough to angle for a Kingdome, intreating him to deſcend and taſte a banquet: ſolemnly ſwearing by <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Ally,</hi> the head of <hi>Shaw Abbas,</hi> by Paradiſe, by eight tranſparent Orbs, and other panym atteſtations, that he ſhould have royall quarter, come and goe as pleaſed him; no other reaſon inducing his invitation, than a hearty good will hee bore him, and hopes of agreement upon parlee. The peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King, unuſed to deceit and warres rotten ſtratagems, ſwallowes the tempting hook, and is credulous they had no perfidy. His wife and ſonnes diſſwade, adding freſh examples of their hypocriſie. But neither thoſe nor the teares his men ſhed to beg his ſtay, vowing their conſtancie to the laſt man, could divert his deſtiny: but downe he goes and findes the Crocodile below ready to embrace him with teares of joy: but after a ſhort banquet, gives him an iron bed; regarding neither vow, honour, nor ingagement. <hi>Bahaman</hi> too late repents his dotage. The Pagan Generall thinks all his owne now, and therefore ſends his ſonne a meſſage of intreaty upon a Speares point, that if they wiſht their fathers ſafety, an end of warre, truce with <hi>Abbas,</hi> and new Grandeur to their fortunes, they ſhould come down; all which by obſtinacie would be forfeited and denied them, yea prove a baſis of perpetuall trouble, and a common monumentall ſhame unto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>

of the faſtidious Pagan, commix diſcretion and pollicy, throw downe this choking anſwer, They would beleeve hee was an honeſt man and condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to any reaſon, ſo the King might have his liberty to come up againe; otherwiſe he might count them Ideots, the villany and perjury to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being ſo freſh amongſt them: from equall reaſon, they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Caſtle and Crowne, as them by whom thoſe things ſubſiſted; other ſatisfaction they would not give ſo vile a miſcreant, this excepted, That the King of <hi>Perſia's</hi> ill-grounded ambition would never proſper; that though of long time he had politely avoyded the Epithite of a Tyrant, this would rub afreſh his former injuſtice, yea anatomize him ſo clearely, that all <hi>Aſya</hi> would account him odious: that all the world might tax him of diſhonourable avarice, who commanding over many fruitfull Provinces, could not reſt contented, without ſubjugating a Nation never wronging him; a King whoſe Ante-ceſſors had for more ages govern'd <hi>Larry-Iohn,</hi> than <hi>Izmaels</hi> poſterity had done <hi>Perſia;</hi> a Country ſo cold and barren, that of more than Title he could not any way better himſelfe: an unholy oſtentation.</p>

So that retorting him this lawleſſe title, <hi>Ius mihi objectas, accincto gladio?</hi> without more plea; invites them, from their conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated cloud, to view their Fathers head off: they reſolutely bid him do as pleaſed him, and to call to minde, murther is inexpiable in their Alcoran. <hi>Methiculibeg</hi> has torne his foxes skin with overſtreching it, ſeeing this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice prove ayre, &amp; knows no way now to blow them up, himſelfe is ſo fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undermined. But giving his rage a vent, in heat of fury he againe aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, they retaliate his hate with ſuch dexterity that many Cooſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhes expir'd their laſt, and ſo many others were bruis'd, that they begun a common mutiny, proteſting to returne whiles poſſible, upbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Generall, that he knew not how to uſe a victory, that <hi>Bahaman</hi> was theirs, Mount <hi>Taurus</hi> theirs, and doubted not, but they would do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage if the <hi>Shaw</hi> would ſo honour him, that with more credit and gaine they could oppoſe the <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Indyan.</hi> The Generall is plung'd into a deadly Dylemma. If he could infuſe patience and make them ſtay, hee knew not how to mount the Caſtle; if he returned without full conqueſt, he knew his head ſhould off; <hi>Ferrat-cawn, Oliverdi-cawn, Kurchichy-cawn,</hi> and other brave Captaines for like faults, being that yeere beheaded. Hee machinates at length another triall; he releaſes <hi>Bahaman,</hi> upon his knees beſeeches pardon: vowing he us'd this ſeeming diſcourteſie, but to try his excellent temper; that his leave to go back was granted him, either to go or ſtay as pleaſed him; that <hi>Abbas</hi> his Maſter had ſent for him, and that he ſhould depart more joyfully, could he but be ſo happy to ſee his ſons, whom for valour and policy he admired above all mortall creatures, that if any Articles and Truce might reciprocally bee ſigned to, oh! what content it would affoord, and fetter him in a thouſand ſlaviſh ingagements. <hi>Bahaman,</hi> is over-joyed at this Syren, never did muſick to his dull eares ſound more melodiouſly; ſome Magick ſpell ſure had infatuated him; he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20354:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beleeves the Perſian, and gives a Sardonick ſmile to think how bleſt hee was in this attonement: he dictates a pathetick letter, and is permitted to ſhew his joy at a diſtance to his ſonnes. A nefarious meſſenger delivers it and bewitches the well-nigh diſtracted Princes with ſuch piſcaſhes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of worth, that accepting them, and joying at the eaſie Articles, they conſult and (fearing to irritate ſo Potent a neighbour to further miſchiefe, the Queene alſo provoking them downe, contrary to the ſoldiers who preſag'd by many ſubmiſſive diſwaſions their ruine) downe they go, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the perfidy of the Generall; who ſounds for joy, and carries them to their endeared Father, twixt whom was ſhewed love and obedience in the height of both; the Generall preſents them a ſolemne banquet, but death attended them. For when theſe three were bleſſing their good deſtiny, ſmiling in a mutuall conſent of love, the Generall gives the ſigne, and at one inſtant three Cooſel-baſhes ſtanding by, with their ſlicing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miters whipt off their heads, all three at one moment made immortall; and ere this villany was ſpread abroad, by vertue of their ſeales, they made the men above deſcend and yeeld the Caſtle, ſome receiving mercy, ſome deſtruction. By that deteſted policy yoaking in ſlavery, this late thought indomitable Nation; ſuch was the miſerable end of <hi>Meleq' Bahaman</hi> and two hopefull Princes, forgetfull of warres ſubtleties: and how <hi>Aladeule</hi> their neighbour King of <hi>Anti-Taurus</hi> for playing faſt and looſe with <hi>Selim</hi> firſt Emperour of <hi>Turqs,</hi> by equall credulity gave a like iſſue to his life and Kingdome. Oppoſit to this Caſtle is erected the Sepulcher of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamans</hi> beloved Queene, in the high-way as wee paſſed: tis of foure equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateralls, elevated eight yards high; the materiall is of ſtone, well ſquar'd and plaſter'd with white, very apparant and comely.</p>
            <p>A long mile from this Sepulcher and higher up into the Aire, is the high peak of <hi>Damoan</hi> (by <hi>Strabo</hi> in his 11. <hi>lib.</hi> call'd <hi>Iaſonia,</hi>) whoſe top (ſhaped like a Pyramid) ſurmounts all the other parts of <hi>Taurus;</hi> up which defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating hill we crambled with no ſmall difficulty, and from whence wee could diſcover the Caſpian Sea, eightſcore long miles diſtant thence; 'tis above compos'd of ſulphur, which cauſes it to ſparkle each night like <hi>Aetna;</hi> a pleaſant object to the eye, but is ſo offenſive to the ſmell, that it requires a noſegay of Garlick in the aſcending; hence, moſt part of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Chaldaea</hi> has their brimſtone: the reaſon why we rode up was out of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, to ſee the baths ſo generally reſorted to, ſo excellently famous.

            <p>Eaſt of <hi>Damoans</hi> high peak is a Towne call'd <hi>Nova,</hi> in it a hundred fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. A young man (ſonne to <hi>Hodge-Suare</hi> the Perſian Merchant that dyed in <hi>London, Anno Domini</hi> 1625, and brother to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whom we buried at ſea) hearing of our paſſing by, accompanied with all his loving kindred, came to invite us to his home; he was apparelled in a long robe of cloth of gold, his head was wreath'd with a huge Shaſh or Tulipant of ſilk and gold, he beſtowed a banquet and hearty welcome, with an invitation of longer time: but after mutuall thanks and ceremony, we return'd a long farewell, and thence haſtned towards <hi>Damoan:</hi> where, as wee deſcended a ſteep hill, wee paſt by a large black Tent, ſtuft with above thirty antick women, &amp; as many men; I thought they had been ſolemnizing their Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilia and Boalia, but it prov'd a wedding; the bride was of ten yeeres, the groome of thirty; ſhe a <hi>Venus,</hi> he a <hi>Vulcan:</hi> many bride-maids came out to admire at us, wee ſtaid awhile no leſſe wondring at them: their faces, hands, and feet were painted in divers formes of birds, beaſts, caſtles, and flowers, reſembling our predeceſſors in <hi>Brittaine</hi> in <hi>Caeſars</hi> time; their
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:20354:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leggs were chain'd with voluntarie fetters of braſſe and ſilver, which in their Moriſco Paſtorall made them appeare more excellent in that ſport than any deſcription of the Arcadian Sheepheardeſſes; wee gave them a a ſmall offering and ſo left them, that night making <hi>Damoan</hi> our Manzeil or Lodging.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Damoan,</hi> (whether the relict of <hi>Ghabor</hi> or <hi>Halah</hi> is incertaine; but by the Jewes (in theſe parts call'd <hi>Iehuds</hi>) their long captivity and abode here, ſeemes to be one of them) is a Town well known unto the Perſians; ſome write it <hi>Damawan,</hi> but erroneouſly. The North Pole is elevated at this place, ſix and thirty degrees, twenty minutes; longitude 88. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the skirt of <hi>Taurus,</hi> in the <hi>Kaboncharion</hi> Province (part of <hi>Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack</hi>) and the limit of <hi>Medya,</hi> North; a Towne pretty well watered, a branch of <hi>Gozan</hi> refreſhes her: peopled moſt part with Jewes, who in this place are two hundred Families: The Buzzar is built aloft, and ſcarce worth the climbing to, except it be to buy wine and fruit, which is had here in plenty and at eaſie prices. Two dayes wee ſtay'd in <hi>Domoan</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creat our wearied bodies; on the thirteenth of June we departed thence, and that day rode to <hi>Bomaheem,</hi> five and twenty miles from <hi>Damoan.</hi>

But in ſtead of them, as many Camells abound here in ſandie Deſarts, and crop the boughes of trees or ſhrubs ſuch as they meet with: a beaſt, albeit generally known, yet may have a ſmall memoriall. The Dromodarie and it are of one deſcent, but varie according to the Countrie they breed in: in <hi>Bactria</hi> (where of old were reckoned a thouſand Cities) and <hi>Perſia</hi> they have but one gib or bunch, the Arabian is doubled. The males in one moneth every yeare burne with too much heat, and grow foaming frantick towards copulation, yet in that diſtraction cannot be brought to commit inceſt, nor will they goe any whither without their conſort: the females are not ſo cholerick;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20354:102"/>
they couple backward, goe great ten moneths, commonly have but one young one at one birth, which they ſuckle two yeares apart from compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, not looſing their milk till a ſecond conception: They live threeſcore yeares, labour much, feed little; refraine drink three dayes, but then quench their thirſt immeaſurably: their milk is cordiall, their fleſh ranck and lean, yet in <hi>Aſia</hi> preferr'd before Beefe, Veale, Pork, in that <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Alcaron or <hi>Ozmon's</hi> Parady, licentiats it.</p>
            <p>This Kingdome was firſt conquered by <hi>Semeramys;</hi> ſome ſay by her ſimple husband <hi>Nynus, Anno mundi</hi> 1900. <hi>Ninus</hi> was ſonne of <hi>Belus</hi> (dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by names of <hi>Bel, Baal,</hi> and <hi>Iupiter Babylonicus;</hi>) ſonne of <hi>Nymrod</hi> (call'd <hi>Mars</hi> by ſome, by others <hi>Saturne</hi>) ſixt ſonne of <hi>Cuſh, Chams</hi> eldeſt ſonne, the curſed brat of <hi>Noah:</hi> or thus, <hi>Noah</hi> had <hi>Cham,</hi> father of <hi>Cuſh</hi> (begot ſome ſay in the Ark) father of <hi>Nymrod</hi> who begat <hi>Baladan,</hi> father to <hi>Berodac</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour to <hi>Nabuchadnezar,</hi> father of <hi>Evel-Merodach,</hi> father of <hi>Bel-ſhazzer,</hi> who (as <hi>Daniel</hi> fore-told) was the laſt of that Aſſyrian pedegree, <hi>Darius Medus</hi> ſupplanting him, <hi>Anno M.</hi> 3426. by ſome call'd <hi>Cyaxares ſecundus,</hi> whoſe daughter and heire was married to <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Fortunate, who by ſlaughter of <hi>Aſtiages</hi> became ſole Monarch of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Since when, it has groaned under twenty changes, but wee will not ſpeak them here; for by this time we are hous'd in <hi>Tyroan.</hi>

            <p>TYROAN, by her continued greatneſſe and Antiquity ſeemes to be that <hi>Rhazunda,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> It is ſeated in the midſt of a faire large Plain; which albeit it be invironed with hills of ſtupendious height in moſt parts at good diſtance, yet ſome wayes it affoords a delicate Horizon. The ayre here is freſh and ſweet in the morning and towards Sunſet, but in the Sunnes perpendicular glances, wee found it hot and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: the houſes are of white bricks, hardned in the Sunne; above three thouſand houſes are numbred in <hi>Tyroan;</hi> of which, the Dukes &amp; Buzzar are the faireſt and moſt obſervable; yet neither ſo excellent as to beget won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: the Market is divided, ſome part thereof is open and ſome arched: a ſweet rivolet playes wantonly in two ſtreames through the Towne, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitating the Groves and Gardens, who for ſuch a favour returne a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Tribute to the Gardiner: adjoyning the Citie, the King has a ſpatious Garden, ſuccinct with a great Towring wall of mud, as much in circuit as is the Citie: The houſe wherein we lodged overtopped all the other, and from whoſe higheſt Tarraſſe (early one morne) I tooke a dainty proſpect both of Towne and Country; every houſe top was ſpread with Carpets, whereon each night ſlept the Maſter of the houſe and his Seralio; ſome (I eaſily perceived) had three, ſome ſix women about them, wrapt in lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen; the curioſity (or raſhneſſe rather) might have coſt me deerely, the penalty being no leſſe than to ſhoot an Arrow into his braines that dares to doe it. The Carravans lodge here, exceeds the Moſque; the men in this Towne are proud, the women lovely, both are curious in novelties; but the jealouſie of the men confines the temper of the weaker ſexes; yet by that little they adventured at, we might ſee, <hi>Vetitis rebus gliſcit volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi> One <hi>Zenal-chan</hi> is the Sultan of this Citie, a man of no worth in our opinion: he had been Ambaſſador from <hi>Shaw-Abbas</hi> to <hi>Rodulph</hi> the ſecond, German Emperour; but his late imployment, his favour with <hi>Abbas,</hi> his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20354:103"/>
wealth, his vexation for <hi>Nogdi-beg</hi> his Cozen; made him ſo proud, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous, that albeit the Ambaſſadour ſent to viſit him, hee return'd no thanks, he took no notice of his being there. The pole Artick is elevated in <hi>Tyroan,</hi> thirty five degrees, forty minutes: foureſcore in longitude. From <hi>Tyroan</hi> we rode to a Village call'd <hi>Charah,</hi> a baſe inhoſpitable place; it affoorded us no ſuſtenance, but torment, ſo much as the ſcalding ſands and frying Sunne could operate, as in too great meaſure we had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of: From hence to <hi>Taurys</hi> is two dayes riding. The Carravans-raw is thus ſhaped.</p>

The North pole is in this famous City elevated 36 deg. and 15 min. long. 85 degrees 30 minutes: by King <hi>Tamas</hi> (ſonne of <hi>Iſmael</hi>) made the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of this Monarchy, the better to affront the intruding Ottomans; the Kingdome it ſtands in, is <hi>Medya;</hi> the Province <hi>Sheirvan,</hi> that part call'd <hi>Deylan:</hi> from <hi>Tabryz</hi> a hundred and eighty miles; from <hi>Hamadan</hi> (the ſepulture of Queen <hi>Eſter</hi> &amp; <hi>Mordecay</hi>) a hundred &amp; ten; from <hi>Sultany</hi> (the reſidence of ſix Sultans) ninety; from <hi>Ardavyl</hi> (the Seigniory of the Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians) eighty; from <hi>Gheylan</hi> ſeventy; from <hi>Farabaut</hi> two hundred; from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchand</hi> five hundred; from <hi>Ormus</hi> eight hundred; from <hi>Babilon</hi> five hundred; from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> a thouſand; from <hi>Spahawn</hi> two hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty; from <hi>Shyraz</hi> foure hundred and ninety; from <hi>Kandahar</hi> five hundred and fifty miles Engliſh, or thereupon.</p>
            <p>It is at this day for multitude of buildings and inhabitants the chiefe in <hi>Medya,</hi> and equall for other grandeur to any other City in the Perſian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>Spawhawn</hi> excepted. It is ſeated in a faire even plaine, no hill of note in thirty miles compaſſe overlooking her; a champaigne yeelding graine and grapes, but little wood ſaw I growing any where. It has a ſmall ſtreame flowing from <hi>Abonda</hi> (<hi>Baronta</hi> of old) which gives the thirſty drink; and mellowes the gardens: from whence by its refreſhment and the peoples induſtry, they have abundance of fruits and roots and in varieties. I think the reaſon why wee ſaw no great rivers in any place, is from their forcing it into many ſluces, to bring it by ſubterranian paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to ſuch Townes as have none but by derivative, in ſo much, that if <hi>Indus, Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Ganges</hi> were amongſt them (I meane where the Country is moſt peopled) doubtleſſe they would make them kiſſe the ſea in five hundred oſtiums or branches. Such fruits as I remember, were Grapes, Orenges, Lymes, Lemons, Pomcytrons, Musk and water Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, Plums, Cherryes, Peaches, Apricocks, Figgs, Gooſeberries, Peares, Apples, Piſtachoes, Filberds, Haſel-Nuts, Wallnuts, Almonds, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pomgranads, Dates, but ſuch as came from <hi>Lariſtan. Casbyn</hi> is circled with a complementall wall, of no force in any adverſity; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe is about 7 miles; the families are twenty thouſand, people about two hundred thouſand, nouriſht by the Ayre, and a few roots and rice, ſuch dyet as beſt complies with ſuch torrid regions. The <hi>Buzzars</hi> here are large and pleaſant, but inferiour to ſome about her. The <hi>Mydan</hi> is uniform and beautifull, the Kings Pallace and Haram are nigh the great Market, low, of raw-bricks, varniſht after the notion of Paynim painting, in blew, red, and yellow tinctures, commixt with Arabiq knots &amp; letters, azure &amp; gold; the windowes are ſpatious, trellized and neatly carved; within, of uſuall

ſplendor; neere his gate, is a great Tanck or Magazyn of water made at the common charge at our being here. The Hummums (or ſweating pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) are many, reſplendent in the azure pargetting and tyling wherewith they are ceruleated; the vulgar buildings content the inhabitants, but to a buſie eye yeeld ſmall wonder or amazement: the gardens are beſt to view and ſmell to, but compared with thoſe in <hi>Spahawn</hi> and <hi>Shyraz,</hi> prove but ordinary and leſſe fruitfull. The Moſq's, or ſuperſtitious houſes, are not two thirds ſo many as <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> computed long ago, above ſix hundred. Nor thoſe ſo faſtidious in Pyramidall aſpirings, nor curious in Architecture, nor inſide glory as in many leſſer Towns obeying <hi>Mahomet.</hi> I cannot inlarge her praiſes, ſave that in Spring and Autumne I beleeve it may be a temperate and inticing climat: but Sommer and Winter are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame in contraries; <hi>Apollo</hi> frying them with his oblique flaming glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and <hi>Hyems</hi> no leſſe benumming them with his icycles.</p>
            <p>Here we met the Pot-ſhaw again, who got into <hi>Casbyn</hi> two dayes afore us. At which time, forty Cammells entred loaden with Tobacco out of <hi>Indya,</hi> the owners and drivers being ignorant that any ſuch prohibition had gone out, to forbid the uſing it; (the King ſometimes commanding and reſtrayning three or foure times every yeere, to ſhew his Monarchic power, and as the humor taketh him,) an ill ſpirit directed them, for <hi>Mamet-Ally-beg</hi> the pernitious Favorite (wanting his piſcaſh it ſeemes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperates <hi>Abbas,</hi> and he forth-with payes the men unwelcome wages; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding an Officer to crop off their eares, and to benoſe them; offering to his angry Juſtice, the forty Cammells burthen of Tutoon or Tobacco, by making a great deep hole the pipe, which being inflam'd, in a black va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por gave the Citizens gratis two whole dayes and nights infernall incenſe. Let me give you ſomewhat to memoriſe <hi>Casbyn,</hi> wherein have been acted many Tragick ſcenes, in their times very terrible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> the purblind King of <hi>Perſia</hi> and Syre to <hi>Shaw-Abbas,</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was peaceable and mercifull; but could reſt never the quieter for ſuch a temper. <hi>Morad</hi> the third, and ſonne to <hi>Selym</hi> that arch-Atheiſt, and Emperour of Turq's (who call'd himſelfe God of the Earth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the whole World) ſquinted ſtill upon the Eaſterne Monarchs, and found none a greater eye-ſore and rub to his conqueſts than <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Perſia:</hi> many attempts he made to ſubject it, but of no force, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py influence of deſtiny ſo ſafeguarded it, Nature it ſelfe laboured to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne that rebell of Nature.</p>
            <p>But let us firſt look back to ſee what ſtormes were rais'd, what incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ingendred, ere he could make the tottering Dyadem ſit cloſe; <hi>Tamas-Shaw</hi> (ſonne to <hi>Iſmael-Sophy</hi> the Jewes reputed Meſſias, till by the juſt hand of God, they found him crueller than <hi>Tytus</hi>) by a Georgian Lady (they are the rareſt in the Orient) had twelve ſonnes, <hi>Mahomet, Iſmael, Aydar-cawn, Solyman, Emangoly, Mamut-Ally, Muſtapha, Ally-cawn, Amet-cawn, Ebrahym, Hamze,</hi> and <hi>Izma-cawn;</hi> the daughters are ſeldom reckned, yet one of them a Virago, <hi>Periacon-Conna</hi> by name plaid her part, and rather than do as other women, ſpin or bee impriſoned, ſhee choſe to practice Armes, and to revive the infamy, yea in every thing to imitate <hi>Semyramis.</hi> King <hi>Tamas</hi> was ſcarce dead (haſtned ſome thinke before

his time) when <hi>Ayder</hi> his third ſonne took advantage of his brethrens ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: <hi>Mahomet</hi> he jeered at, as unworthy the crowne by reaſon of his imperfection; hee could not ſee to fight, to diſcerne, to governe. <hi>Iſmael</hi> was abroad upon ſome imployment, and therefore <hi>Periacon-Conna</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, he graſpt the Scepter and impald his browes with his Fathers Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem, his brothers right, his owne confuſion: for he had not ſwayed full foure dayes, when <hi>Sahamel-cawn</hi> (his inſinuating Uncle) moſt audatiouſly ſtruck off the crowne, and (to adde preſumption) made the loſſe of his head ſatisfie his too haſty ambition. <hi>Zenall-cawn</hi> his friend grumbles at it, but had not power to queſtion him. <hi>Periacon-Conna</hi> finding her ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſt to <hi>Ayder,</hi> ſhewes her ſelfe a right woman in her conſtancy: for without any revenge of <hi>Ayders</hi> death or ſorrowing to his grave, ſhe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers her love to <hi>Iſmael,</hi> who by her foot-poſt has notice of his brothers ill-end and favour of the Sultans towards him. Ambition lends him wings, ſo that he quickly arrives at <hi>Casbyn,</hi> and by men of note is joyfully welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the monſter multitude ſaluted King. His conſcience accuſes him of intruſion, but checks him not to make ſuch a conſtruction as Law and Nature required from him: he reſolves to rule, and to cut off ſuch rubbs as made the way unſafe to mount upon: his brothers had no title to it, (I meane, none but <hi>Mahomet</hi>) yet the name affrights him: 8 innocent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſlaine to quench his infernall inflammation, regarding neither grace, his Fathers ſoule, the perfume of that name, the name of Tyrant, juſtice, nor the peoples mutability, who by that cruelty begun to hate him, and to wiſh the right heyre in his lawfull royalties. <hi>Mahomet</hi> alſo begins to ſtirre, if not for the crowne, at leaſt to free himſelfe from his brothers blood-thirſtineſſe; but he no ſooner practis'd to bee active, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ground their loyalty and affection on him, and in great troopes flock about him, vowing to have him King in <hi>Casbyn,</hi> or in the attemp to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice themſelves. Whiles <hi>Iſmael</hi> growes odious to God and Man: for, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vulgar ſort and others fall away, in a high contempt of them, and to ruine all, he confederates with the Turq, intending to betray the honor of his crowne, and to ſhade himſelfe under their greatneſſe; yea to vex his owne, and to ingratiate the Turks the more, apoſtatizes, proclaiming the error of the Perſian reformation, crying out that <hi>Ally</hi> was no body, compared to <hi>Mahomets</hi> three ſucceſſors, and the like frantick impoſtures; which how ſubtlely ſo ere hee cloakt, his tricks deceived him; for one night (a diſmall night to him) his ſiſter weather-cock and foure inraged Sultans, <hi>Chalyle, Emyr, Mohummed,</hi> and <hi>Curchy-cawn</hi> entred his bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in womens apparell, where <hi>Iſmael</hi> thinking to coole his laſcivious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, was by thoſe Amazons ſtrangled in a cord of ſilke, foming out his infected ſpirit, unable to reſiſt the fury of thoſe conſpirators, and diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned when hee ſaw his ſiſter one of them. <hi>Casbyn</hi> was clouded with ſhame and amazement, but cleares up when <hi>Mahomet</hi> enters circled with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgent Diadem. <hi>Periacon-conna</hi> dreames not of an account: but <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> acquainted with her turbulent and variable nature, commands <hi>Salmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirza</hi> to arreſt her with the axe of death, which accordingly hee executes, and ſends her Gorgons head, the hayre diſhevelling upon a ſpeares poynt as a ſymboll of his obedience unto the King: her complices upon the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

that the <hi>Tattar</hi> finds himſelfe double fettered: but after much parlee and fight they tooke truce and grew ſo co-united, that the Sultans in <hi>Casbyn</hi> took notice of it; but neither regarding her Majeſtie nor his youth, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alſo that the King intended to make him his ſonne in law (no diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, being the great <hi>Cams</hi> brother) all theſe neglected, they broke in, at ſuch an unluckie time as they were acting ſome inchaſtity; a ſight ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the jealous Sultans, that they firſt made him an Eunuch, and after that ſlew them both; concluding ſo, <hi>Anno Heg.</hi> 958. the end and tryumphs of the Praecopenſian Tartar.</p>
            <p>After ſome ſtay in <hi>Cazbeen,</hi> our Ambaſſador to ſwiften his diſpatch, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the Load-ſtarre of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the grand Favorite <hi>Mahomet Ally-beg;</hi> who entertain'd him with a loftie look, and wiſht him to truſt his ſecrets to his Cabinet, wherein the myſteries of the whole ſtate was lockt, the King ſhewing himſelfe unwilling to be further troubled. The Ambaſſadour might in any other place than <hi>Perſia</hi> have return'd him the Lye; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no remedy, and deſiring to haſte home, imparted ſo much as hee ſaw neceſſarie. Touching Sir <hi>Robert Sherley,</hi> hee was to expect no other ſatisfaction; his enemie was dead, and at the Caſpian ſea the King had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently honoured him: but to ſpeak truly, the Pot-ſhaugh had then no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him, when by reaſon of his age hee was diſabled to doe him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice; adding (but out of an Enemies mouth) that all his Ambaſſies and meſſages to the Princes of Chriſtendome were frivolous and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit: But when our Ambaſſadour objected, he was in perſon there to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his authority, that he had the Kings Letter of credence to teſtifie, ſign'd and ſtampt by the <hi>Shaugh</hi> himſelfe; and that it had beene a ridiculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in <hi>Sherley</hi> to have dared to conteſt with <hi>Abbas</hi> to his face, if hee had beene an Impoſtor; the Favorite had not wherewith to anſwer, ſave that ſo our Ambaſſador pleas'd to lend him that Phirman Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> had brought in his defence, hee would returne it him next day, with his Maſters ſpeach concerning it.</p>
            <p>A vexation it muſt needs be to my Lord Ambaſſadour, to treat in this uncivill ſort by a malicious proxy: neceſſitie forced it. Three dayes paſſed, ere <hi>Mahomet-Ally-beg</hi> would vouchſafe to returne the Letter, or give that ſatiſfaction he had promiſed; at length he came and told the Ambaſſadour that the King had lookt upon it, had denied it to be his, and in a great rage had burnt it; wiſhing Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> would depart his Kingdome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (old, and as hee thought) troubleſom. It was in vaine to chalenge the pragmatique Pagan in point of honour, nor knew he any recourſe by juſtice to eaſe himſelfe. We all were verily perſwaded, he never ſhew'd it to the King, nor had any way enquired of him concerning it. The truth is, he had beene brib'd, but by whom, is unneceſſarie to ſpeak of, it may be wee did but conjecture it; yet no doubt, <hi>Abbas</hi> was hereby too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed; his juſtice, and diſcretion, and courage would have proceeded otherwiſe: beſides, his proteſtation againſt <hi>Nogdibeg</hi> (as wee have noted) and <hi>Ebrahym Chan</hi> his ſonne, not daring to ſhew himſelfe in Court, till <hi>Synall Chan</hi> mediated his peace, (not that he, but his Father had offended) made it as apparant as the Sunne, that there was jugling: the truth is, Sir <hi>Robert Sherley's</hi> old age and diſability to ſerve the Perſian,

beſtowed on this man ſhe ſo long liv'd with, ſhe ſo much cheriſhed.</p>
            <p>At what time her beloved Lord lay dead, and ſhe halfe dead through a long diſſentery, to comfort her (after the faſhion of <hi>Perſia</hi>) one <hi>Iohn</hi> a Dutch man, a Jew, a Painter; regarding neither her ſex, her faith, her melancholly; complots with <hi>Mamet-Ally-beg</hi> to undoe her, by pretending a deepe engagement her husband was in to one <hi>Crole</hi> a Flemmin, &amp; (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee was dead) bad her ask him if it were not true; if hee denied it, it ſhould be forfeited. She might have pay'd them by like Sophiſtry, that if he would affirme it, ſhe would pay it them. But, they haſte to the Cawſee or Juſtice to attach her goods, and a faithfull honeſt Gentleman of our company has quick notice of it, Mr. <hi>Robert Hedges</hi> by name, who haſtens to her houſe and perſwades her to make quick conveyance: at which, the amazed Lady tears the Sattin quilt ſhe lay upon, and with her feeble hands ſhewes that pathetique vertue a ſtronger could not well have bettered; and taking thence a Cabinet, ſome Jewells and rich Jems, intreats that worthy Gentleman to ſafegard them, till the danger was gone: he readily obeyes, and is no ſooner out of doores, when <hi>Iohn</hi> the Boor enters with ſupercilious looks, attended by ſome Pagan Sergeants, who (without much talk to her, or pitty to her diſtreſſe) rifled about, broke-ope her Cheſts, and carried away what was valuable or vendible; ſome rich Veſts, coſtly Tarbants, and a Dagger of great price; but finding no Jewells (ſuch they had ſeene him weare, and the Oeſtrich Feather alſo, which they had wooried in their Oſtrich appetite) they grew madded with ſhame, and made her Horſes, Camells, and Aſſes beare them company, not caring if the Lady ſtarved. The Gentleman, ſo ſoone as the skie was cleare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and beſides his words of comfort, gladded her heart in delivering her her Jewels againe, of double value by that conqueſt: without which good hap, I am perſwaded her other fortune reacht not to fifty pound: a ſmall revenue for ſo brave a Lady; and eſpecially uſefull is money in thoſe uncharitable Regions, where women are made ſlaves to libidinous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: but God provided better for her, and (beyond our expectation) has placed her in <hi>Rome,</hi> where I heare ſhee now moſt happily enjoyes her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Like diſcontents, long conflict with flames of Adverſity, and foureteene dayes conſuming of a deadly flux (it may be eating too much fruit, or ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in too much chil ayre on <hi>Taurus</hi> cauſed it) brought that religious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Sir <hi>Dodmore Cotton</hi> the Ambaſſador, in the vigour of his age, to an immortall home: the 23 of July (14 dayes after Sir <hi>Sobert Sherley</hi>) he bad us <hi>Adieu;</hi> our duty commanding us to ſee him buried in the beſt ſort wee could.

In that happy minute of all minutes, <hi>Abbas</hi> by accident caſt his eye upon him; a magick infuſion it had it ſeemes, for from the Apple-basket, he is roab'd in gold, and quickly made the Magnet of <hi>Perſia;</hi> his yeerely revenue at our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, I heard by many men eſtimated a hundred and forty thouſand pounds ſterlin: and well may bee, not any Mirza, Cawn, Sultan, nor Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerbeg that depended upon the Pot-ſhaughs ſmiles, but in an awfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, made him their Anchor by ſome annuall piſcaſh, bribe, or other: his preſence was very comly, and taking; of a ſweet countenance, made amiable by many complementall ſmiles: hee is of a big full body; large eyes and noſe; and huge muſtachoes: was at this time aged forty, a third part of which hee had beene Fortunes minion.

               <hi>Caſhan</hi> is not leſſe than <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Norwich,</hi> above foure thouſand families are accounted in her: the houſes are fairely built, the ſtreets be large and comly; the Moſqus and Hummums are curiouſly painted and ceruleated, with a feigned Turquoiſe: the Buzzar is ſpatious and uniforme; furniſhed with Silks, Damasks, rich Carpets, Sattens, and cloth of gold; no part of the Perſian Monarchy ſhewes better, or more variety, nor a people more exactly induſtrious. The gardens, and fruits, and corne, are by the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borat Tymariots made to fructifie, and being cultivated retribute a gainfull acknowledgement. The Carravans-raw in this Citie is an inimitable (if not ſo, an unparaleld) Arch Fabrick, by many degrees preceding all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans-raws in <hi>Perſia;</hi> for this is able to lodge the Court of the greateſt Potentate in <hi>Aſia:</hi> but built by <hi>Abbas</hi> for Travellers to repoſe in <hi>gratis,</hi> to ſhew the world hee joyed in ſome act of charity: the whole building is grounded with Marble, ſix foot high; the reſidue is brick are fied in the Sunne, varniſht and coloured with knots and fancies of Arabick characters, in azure, red, and white, in oyle, after the common mode of <hi>Perſia.</hi> It is a perfect quadrant; each angle is from one another two hundred paces, the whole eight hundred: in the umbelique or mid-part of this ſpatious Court is a quadrangular Tanck or Pond fill'd (by an Aquae-duct) with chryſtallin water: this royall Inne, is alſo circum-volv'd with ſuch fragrant and ſpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gardens as rather exceed than want to diſplay the founders magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: more, I have not to denotate, ſave that many ſeverall conjectures, by many ſeverall learned men and Antiquaries, have paſſed, whence the <hi>Magi</hi> or wiſe men came, that preſented our bleſſed Saviour with their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings, and were without doubt the firſt fruits, and called of the Gentiles: and albeit call'd <hi>Magi</hi> (or deeply read in Nature) yet no queſtion, they were illuminated and wayted the accompliſhment of that Propheſie of <hi>Balaam,</hi> in 24 <hi>Num,</hi> 17. <hi>There ſhall come a Starre out of Iacob and a Scepter ſhall riſe out of Iſrael, and ſhall ſmite the corners of Moab and deſtroy the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Seth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Magi of Perſia.</note> They gathered, I ſay, more from this of their Prophet than any of their own Aſtrologick obſervations.

The word <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> is moſt proper to <hi>Perſia; Perſia</hi> is Eaſt from <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> And many are of opinion they came from hence or <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> where then flouriſht a famous Academy. The people here have ſuch a Tradition, that hence went thoſe three wiſe men or Kings, which ſome ſay were intomb'd in <hi>Cullen:</hi> but few are of this opinion: Some ſay they came from <hi>Saba</hi> or <hi>Sheba</hi> in <hi>Sabea</hi> or <hi>Arabia,</hi> from <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> South; deceiv'd in <hi>Cuſh, Aethiops,</hi> but firſt in <hi>Araby.</hi> From <hi>Babylon</hi> ſome think they came; from <hi>Shuſhan</hi> ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; from <hi>Ormus</hi> ſome gueſſe, as likely as it was Paradiſe: from <hi>Ceyloon,</hi> from <hi>Tabropan,</hi> from any place, no matter where; ſince the ſacred pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have beene ſilent in it.

So thought <hi>Abbas;</hi> and thence deriv'd that unkinkly trade of ſending into the market, his dayly preſents of fruits and flowers (for without ſome piſcaſh was no ſaluting him,) a kind of thriſt,<note place="margin">His dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick pollicy.</note> he not only boaſted of (I imagin as <hi>Ageſlaus</hi> did of his polt-foot) but ſeemed to complain of the too great nici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of other Kings. And no doubt, if all the Potentates of the earth were inquired after, none would parallell this late old Monach of <hi>Perſia</hi> for ſtartagems in good husbandry, (for ſo, to reſpect the man, we had beſt call it.) He could finely dart his wonder upon ſuch &amp; ſuch a Town by report or letter confeſſing his amazement at ſight of ſome great Elephant, or Tower of gold he heard they had acted: they dare not reaſon againſt it, they know the meaning; and in pure gold get ſuch a preſent; if rich and heavy, then tis dainty work, though never ſo diſordered: if otherwiſe, then no way praiſed. Ninety wall'd Townes are under his command (the Villages are above forty thouſand) none of which eſcape his policy; for though they practice nothing leſſe than gold-ſmiths work and imagery, yet hee ſalutes them with a falſe report, deſiring to ſee experimentally, whether fame had not beene a niggard in their elevation: they embrace the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and returne him in pure gold the Icon of an Elephant, Cammell, or Dromedary: ſome a Pegaſus, a Ceſterne or Bath ſome ſend to gaine his love, and ſome a Babel; or repreſentation of ſuch a great Citie as they know will take him, by compariſon: conſidering which, I leſſe admire that vaſt treaſure of Mammoniſme, commonly taken out for oſtentation at the receit of Ambaſſadors or Travellers of note; ſuch as in <hi>Moſendram</hi> our eyes were glutted with. In warre, no Aſiatick Prince was maſter of more Art or ſure experience; at home, his Genius travaili'd with no fewer fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, none withou its certaine end to agrandiſe his treaſurie.

Let us go a little further.</p>
               <p>In old times they were Idolaters, ſuch as the Gowers be now,<note place="margin">The old Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</note> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees a ſect in <hi>Indya,</hi> the Pegouans, &amp;c. but by converſe with Greeks and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans aboliſht their celeſtiall worſhip, and (as <hi>Strabo</hi> relates) received De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monomanie, continued till <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The tranſparent Firmament they called <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of other gods, him they feared: but, <hi>Apollo</hi> (the Sonne, or <hi>Mithra</hi> as they term'd him) they doated on, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to him many gallant Temples, attiring him with many Epethites of honour, health and gentleneſſe: a good opinion then, and not yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled; as yet memorizing his image in the ſtamp and coat Armor of their Emperours. The Moone no doubt had due reſpect and adoration amongſt them, ſuppoſing her eſpouſed to <hi>Apollo. Venus</hi> had equall reverence: the Earth alſo, the Water, Ayre, and Fire, wanted not the names of Dieties, eſpecially the Fire and Water. <hi>Zertooſt</hi> their Law-giver (in imitation of <hi>Moſes</hi>) charged them to keepe a perpetuall fire, not to bee fed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cumbuſtibles, nor to be kindled or inflamed with prophane Ayre, but ſuch as came from the beames of that glorious eye of heaven the Sunne, lightning, flints, or the like. The water alſo by no means was to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with dead carkaſſes, durt, urine, raggs, or what ſhewed ſordiditie or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtineſſe. They loved images but indifferently; uſually actuating their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rites, in groves, in mounts, and conſpicuous places. Their marriages were commonly celebrated in the ſpring, ſuch time as <hi>Phoebus</hi> makes the <hi>Aequinoctium;</hi> the Bridegroome the firſt day juncketting on nothing

Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligamy they liked of, the King giving the example, and honouring them with moſt applauſe and gratuities who prov'd Fathers of moſt children. They ſeldome ſaw their Infants till paſt foure yeeres old, from which age to twenty, they learnt to ride, ſhoot, jaculate, and to ſpeak the truth; as alſo, to fare meanely, lodge hard, to watch, to till the earth, and to bee content with ſmall things. The old men went plaine; the young mens habit was rich, but in nothing ſo notable as when their armes and legs were fettered with voluntary lincks and chaines of burniſht gold, whoſe fulgor they adored from its conformitie with the Sunne: in warre their attire was ſteely or mailed work, curiouſly concatenated, their breaſt-plates skald, their Targets of Oxe hides, large and round, their cap (or helmet) was a Tyara of linen multiplicated; their Armes were darts, bowes, ſwords, and axes; all which in admirable equipage and order, through long practice they could manage gallantly. Their meales (the great mens tables I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you to) were ſplendid in rich furniture &amp; diſhes of gold; but in meats, verie ordinary, and ſparing, <hi>Bacchus</hi> their countriman taught them the Art of drunkenneſſe (<hi>Noah</hi> ſome imagine him, of whom a moderne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſayes boldly. <hi>Omnia vero Bacchanalia eorumque ritus a Noae ebrietate originem habent, &amp;c.</hi> followed greedily by theſe epedemic drunkards, delighted in with no ſmall redundancie; inſomuch that (like the Duch at this day) no matter of moment paſt currant and with applauſe ſave what reliſht of Bacchiſme; yea, their frequent conſultations and private bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines (we too much ape them) were rarely ratified, unleſſe negotiated, and conſolidated in froath and drunkenneſſe: Their complements were heartie and not various; to equalls, affoording imbraces; to ſuperiours, bowing the head and knee, to this houre continued without much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration: the reſt I offer not, this in my conceit ſufficing to parallell the moderne cuſtomes, and to ſet them off with better luſtre.</p>

               <p>In peace, they are not alwayes idle; ſolacing their active bodies in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts of warlike exerciſes. They cannot dance, except as <hi>Pirrhus</hi> taught the Epyrots. They love to hunt and chaſe the Stagg, the Antilope, Gazal,<note place="margin">Exerciſes.</note> Tyger, Bore, Goat, Hare, Fox, Jackall, Woolfe, and the like, abounding there. In which paſtimes they have ſingular skill, courage and dexterity; in Bow, Dart, Scemiter, Gun, and Javelin. Their Harquebuz is longer than ours, but thinner and not ſo good for ſervice. They can uſe that very well, but deteſt the trouble of the Cannon, and ſuch field peeces as require car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. They have good Greyhounds not unlike the Iriſh, apt to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any Lyon. They have Spaniells alſo but not ſo good as their Hawkes may challenge. They have many excellent Eyeries of Eagles, Lannars, Goſhawkes, and Hobbies: their beſt Falcons are out of <hi>Ruſsia</hi> and other Scythick Provinces; they fly them at choiſe game; commonly at Hares, Jackalls, Partrich, Pheſant, Herne, Pellican, Poot, Eſtrich, &amp;c. Their Lures, Jeſſes, Varvills, &amp; Hoods, are richly ſet with ſtones of great price &amp; luſtre. The vulgar ſort delight in Morice dancing, wraſtling, aſſaulting, bandying, Ram and Cock-fighting; wherein they ſpend much time: but value not their money to ſee Boyes dance, or Lavoltoes upon the rope, wherein they are very excellent.</p>
               <p>Their Phyſitians are great admirers of Nature,<note place="margin">Phyſicians.</note> and doat ſo much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that they make that oft-times the firſt cauſer which indeed is but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall or ſecundarie: morall men they are, and humane in language and garbe, both which beget eſteeme and honor from all that know them: and did not avarice (a vice predominating there, and by occaſion of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in me full dearly exemplified) and Magick ſtudies too far ſway them, I could value them above the reſt; however as they are, they paſſe for a generation uſefull and exquiſite.

another in Title, as their skill and Seniority merits. The Doctors are nam'd <hi>Haekeems</hi> (it may be radically from the Hebrew word <hi>Hachajim,</hi> that is, a life-preſerver) <hi>Mulaii</hi> in the Arabick. Mountebanks or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſters are nick-nam'd <hi>Shitan-Tabib,</hi> i.e. the Devills Chirurgion. They are Maſters of much knowledge and ignore not the Mathematiques. Many Arabick Writers have flouriſht in thoſe parts, moſt of whoſe Bookes they read and practiſe by, namely <hi>Galen, Averroys, Hippocrates, Alfarabius, Avy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenna, Ben-Iſaack, Abu-Ally, Mahummed-Abdilla, Ben-Eladib, Abu-becr, Rhazis, Algazzallys',</hi> and <hi>Albumazar.</hi> In Geography <hi>Abul-foeda</hi> and <hi>Alphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganus,</hi> from whom they better their diſcourſe, and by ſuch Lectures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come admirable. Nor want they the knowledge of herbs, drugs, and gums, the Mydan in <hi>Spahawn</hi> abounding in ſingular variety, and than which, no place in the world can more aptly be termed a Panacaea, a Catholicon, of herbs, of drugs; a Magazein 'gainſt all diſeaſes: having alſo no leſſe choice of delicious fruits, rare gums and aromatique odours. This I obſerved, that to ſuch of us as had fluxes they gave Sloes, Ryce, Cynomon, Pomgranad, Barbaries; to purge melancholy, Alloës, Senna, Rhuparb; for phlegme Turbith; for colds &amp; ſweatings, oyles of Beaver, of Leopards, of Jackalls, <hi>herba maris,</hi> our Ladies Roſe, &amp;c. Which I note to ſhew you they have ſome skill and reſembling Europaean preſcriptions. Howbeit, ſweating in Sudatories is the Epidemic Phyſick there, moſt us'd, of leaſt charge and very uſefull; inſomuch that ſome Cities have above threeſcore hummums or baths: ſome ſay three hundred. Phlebotomy is but little us'd; not that it is bad, not perhaps becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> and the other old Naturaliſts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us'd it.</p>
               <p>They deſire rather to tread in an antick path of ignorance, then by any new invention or wholſome ſtudy to wrong the judgements of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceſſors: becauſe forſooth <hi>Eventus varios res nova ſemper habet.</hi> And hence it is (as I imagine) that they continue their maimed calculations, out of a blind conceit that antiquity commanded them; for they compute their yeares only by the Moone,<note place="margin">Lame cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.</note> not by that courſe and motion of the Sun; affirming, that the firmament or eighth heaven finiſhes its revolution in two and thirty yeares; which is falſe: his diurnall motion from Eaſt to Weſt compleating it ſelfe in foure and twentie houres; his other from Weſt to Eaſt, but one degree in a hundred yeares; ſuch is the violence of the firſt mover. Notwithſtanding, it may be they meane the heaven of <hi>Saturne</hi> adjoyning it, (whoſe revolution comes neere their time) finiſhing its journey from Weſt to Eaſt in 30 yeares. And thus, their Lunarie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is ſubject to no ſmall errour, reckning from the Autumnall Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox 12 Moones, the number of dayes in a whole yeare 353. Our Solar computation exceeding theirs twelve dayes at leaſt, every yeare; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to paſſe, that 30 of our yeares make 31 of theirs; whence, the difference ariſes 'twixt us and them in their Aera or Hegyrath, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by protract, will cauſe much more confuſion.</p>
               <p>Such as practiſe manufactures, are meanly reputed of; but they live oft-times verie plentifully and more ſecurely from the jealous eye of the King than doe many great ones,<note place="margin">Inferior ſort of Perſians.</note> who oft deceive their thoughts that they are happier. Of all others the Peſants are moſt miſerable; they can call no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20354:123"/>
their owne, ſuch is the rapine and pride of the great Begs of the Country; nay, every petrie Coſel-baſh dares domineere over them. Yet upon too much abuſe the Cauſee will yeeld them favourable juſtice.</p>
               <p>Generally, the Perſians are facetious, harmleſſe in diſcourſe, not very inquiſitive of exotique alterations, ſeldome tranſgreſſing this demand,<note place="margin">Diſpoſition.</note> if ſuch and ſuch a Country have good wine, faire women, ſwift horſes, and ſharp weapons: chooſing rather to fatten themſelves by a contented No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than by curious inquiſition to perplex their other recreations. Few of them know how to read, <hi>Bellona</hi> trayning them up in iron dances; but honour ſuch as have it: the Church-men, Clerks, and Santos, attracting them. Some skill they have in Muſick; the Dorick and Phrygick, a ſoft and loftie ſort of Conſort. But above all, Poetry lulls them, that Genius ſeeming properly to delight it ſelfe amongſt them. Mimographers I needs muſt call them, their common Ballads reſounding out the acts of <hi>Mars</hi> and his Miſtreſſe, to which two Saints they vow their life and beſt devotion: <hi>Elgazzuly, Ibnul Farid,</hi> and <hi>Elfargani</hi> firſt taught it them: and how lame ſo ere the verſes are, their gracefull chanting and quavering (after the French ayre) gives it to the eare, ſound and harmonious. And, albeit the men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not to dance themſelves, yet dancing is much eſteemed there: the Ganimeds and Layeſians (wanton Boyes and Girles) foot it moſt admirably and in order: I may call them Mymallonian dances; the bells, braſſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molets, ſilver fetters, and the like recording <hi>Bacchus.</hi> They are in this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe ſo elaborate, that each limb and member ſeemes to emulate, yea, to contend who may expreſſe the moſt taking motion; their hands, eyes, bums, geſticulating ſeverally, ſwimming round, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forming themſelves to a Dorique ſtilneſſe, the Ganimeds with incanting voices &amp; extorted bodies ſimpathizing; nothing but poeſie, mirth, wine, &amp; admiration condominating. But were this all, 'twere more excuſable; for (though each has his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Seralio) theſe whores ſeldome goe without their wages: and in a higher degree of perfect baſeneſſe, theſe Paederaſts (by Helliſh permiſſion and the Alcurran) affect thoſe painted, antick roab'd Youths or Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites in a Sodomitic way (not till then compleating the Roman proverb <hi>Perſicos odi Puer apparatus;</hi>) a vice ſo deteſtable, ſo damnable, ſo unnaturall as forces hell to ſhew its uglineſſe before its ſeaſon.

To work they ſtraightway goe: one holds his knee; a ſecond, diſroabs him; a third, holds his hands; others by ſome triviall conceit ſtrive to win his thoughts, to extenuate his inſuing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Prieſt (having muttered his orizons) dilates the praepuce and in a trice (with his ſilver ſciſſers) circumciſes him, applies a healing powder of ſalt, Date-ſtones, and cotton-wooll; the ſtanders by to joy his initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Mawmetry throw downe their <hi>Munera Natalitia,</hi> and ſalute him by that canonick name of <hi>Muſſulman.</hi> If the ceremonie be at home, they then provide a ſolemne banquet; ere which be done, the Boy enters well attended, is uncloath'd afore them all and circumciz'd; and in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of ſuch a benefit (imitating <hi>Abraham</hi> when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was weaned) continue a feaſt three dayes together; at the end whereof, the child is led about in ſtate, bath'd and purg'd from all ſorts of ſinnes; has a Turbant of white ſilk put on his head, and all the way as hee returnes is ſaluted with acclamations. But ſuch an apoſtat raſcall as to ſwill in luxurie the more, or to roabe himſelve with ſome title or advancement (forgetting that for a baſe and momentanie applauſe or pleaſure they diſroabe their ſoule of everlaſting happineſſe, ſuch as runnes paralell with the lines of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie) are brought before the Caddi, who upon his aſſent leads him into the Moſq' and without much ſtirre is cut and marked for a Mahomitan (or child of perdition;) which done, that devill incarnate to witneſſe his rebellion, ſpurnes with his accurſed feet the Croſſe, the hyerogliphick of our ſalvation: which in the primitive and pureſt age was of ſuch honour amongſt the Chriſtians, as not only they uſed it in baptiſme, but upon their foreheads to deſpight the Jewes and Heathens, and to glory in that thing the more, they ſo branded them with as a calumnie.

               <p>Their weddings have not much variety to dwell upon; obſerve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Poli-gamie is tolerable; <hi>Mahomet</hi> to excuſe his owne infirmity,<note place="margin">Marriages.</note> and borrowing it from the Romans, honours ſuch moſt as have moſt wives, and beget moſt children: to furniſh the Emperour with ſouldiers for defence, Paradize with Saints, and to reſound the meritorious praiſes of great <hi>Mahomet:</hi> the Deruiſſe an order of begging Frier excepted, who from a tranſcendent conceit of their owne purity, abhor matrimony, but ſuppoſe Sodomy and Natures blackeſt villanies no ſinne, or ſins pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; producing <hi>Mahomet</hi> their prototype or example, who both by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and cuſtome warranted it: but I have tyed your chaſt eares too long to ſo impure a ſubject. Such therefore as dare wed (they need not feare in <hi>Aſia,</hi> the women in thoſe parts never predominate) they provide a ſum of mony and buy her good-will, her parents being no further charged than to bathe and purifie her. They marry more from report than knowledge, the friends of either party commonly commending, perſwading, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it. The day appointed being come, the Bride is vailed with a fine lawne of callico, her armes and hands are only naked: they mount her bravely, and a great troop of friends and kin accompany her to Church, in the mid-way being met with an equall number of friends, all together agrandizing the ceremonie; after a joynt aſſent of him and her, they alight and enter the Moſque, where the <hi>Mulay</hi> takes the proteſt of their good liking; ſhe demanding three things (as did the Jewiſh women of old,) bed-right, food, and cloathing: their Fathers alſo ſpeak themſelves conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the Prieſt circles them with a ſacred cord, conjoynes their hands, takes a reciprocall oath, and calls <hi>Mahomet</hi> to witneſſe: the Caddy inrolls their names, the houre, day, month, and yeere of their nuptialls, and with an <hi>Eugè</hi> diſmiſſes them. The firſt day vapors away in Tobacco, feaſts, and other ordinary feaſtivalls, the men and women being ſevered: at night, the Bride enters a ſtove, and is ſoundly waſht and perfum'd, that her degree may the better appeare, and her perſon be more accepted of: next night they bathe together, and ſeven dayes after; in which time if hee diſcover her to be no Virgin, ſhe is return'd to her parents with no ſmall diſhonour; otherwiſe is kept till death part them. The Alcoran allowes inceſtuous mariages, pretending that thereby true love is better contracted, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conſerved in families: in caſe alſo the man be weary of her, or that ſhe is barren, he acquaints the Mulay with his diſtemper, who eaſes him upon his giving her a dowry; after which, it may be hee will require her againe, and if ſhe agree, are ſecondly married; yea, five, ſix, ſeven times rejecting and revoking, as hate or luſt can ſtimulate: by that diſorder, love vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, jealouſie budding, rage advancing, clamours roaring; and by which, many times the Fathers neither know their own Children, nor they their parents.</p>

                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> being earneſt in his prayers was accidentally conveighed into Paradize, where being very earneſt in beholding its rare varieties, at length hee caſt his eyes upon the glorious Throne of the Almighty; and (perceiving the Lord to turne about) fearing he ſhould bee ſeverely whipt for ſuch preſumption, bluſhes for ſhame, and ſweats with terror; but loth to have it ſeene, wipes off his brow the pretious ſweat with his firſt finger, and threw it out of Paradiſe: it was not loſt, for, forthwith dividing it ſelfe into ſix drops, all of them became miraculous creatures: the firſt drop became a fragrant Roſe (therefore is roſe-water ſo much uſed there, and in honor of the Roſe an Annuall feaſt ſolemnized:) the ſecond, a grain of Ryce, (a holy graine:) the other foure, foure famous Doctors, who (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Pallas</hi> for their ſiſter) helpt <hi>Mahomet</hi> to compile his holy Alcoran.

Camells fleſh they ſell commonly in the Buzzars roaſted upon ſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets or cut in mammocks and carbonadode, three or foure ſpits valuing two pence. Bad paſtery men they are, they put a lamb whole into a kinde of oven, and take it out as black as a cole; they ſay (I dare not ſecond it) it taſts curiouſly; it may bee ſo, but I feare ſcarce well: well it may bee to a famiſht martialiſt, not ſo in banquets. The poore are not ſo voluptuous: they content themſelves with drie ryce, herbs, roots, fruit, lentills, and a meat reſembling thlummery: Dates alſo preſerved in ſirrup commixt with butter-milk, is pretious food and phyſicall. But, to memorize their Cheeſe and Butter will make your mouths water at it; I ironize: in good earneſt the cheeſe is the worſt any ever taſted of, both that it wants Art and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls: tis drie, and blew, and hard; ill to the eye, bad to the taſte,

But the Perſians in this are commendable; they never quarell in their cups, yet ſuch uſually irritates: nor compell they any to ſit longer than hee pleaſe (ariſing without any excuſe,) nor drink they one unto another; a prejudicat conceit tis in any man to think all brains alike in ſuch more than beaſtly exerciſes; a baſe cuſtome, too much abus'd in this Age of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; forgetting that <hi>Minos</hi> an old Heathen ſtrictly forbad it the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, as <hi>Plato</hi> warrants in his Dialogues.

               <head>The Religion of the Perſians.</head>
               <p>THE Perſian Religion at this day varies not from the Turks in any particle of the Alcoran; and yet they account one the other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and are no leſſe zealous and divided in their profeſſion, than wee and the Papalins: a deviſion begun <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1400, by a Syet of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doveil</hi> (a Citie in <hi>Media;</hi>) the better to advance the Sophyan Title to the Crowne, derived from <hi>Mortis Ally</hi> their famous predeceſſor, coſen and ſonne in law to <hi>Mahumet:</hi> which <hi>Ally,</hi> albeit hee had juſt right to ſit as Kalyph at <hi>Mecca</hi> next to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> yet in his deſpight, three other men ſtept up before him; and during their lives kept him in ſlaverie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him. Theſe three, <hi>Abuboker, Omer,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ozman,</hi> are by the Turks moſt venerably accounted of; but by the Perſians (as appeares by their curſing them in a prayer made by <hi>Syet Gunet</hi>) as impoſtors, doggs, and hereticks; whereby is ſown ſuch mortall hatred betwixt theſe two potent Monarchs that (to Europs good) they abominate each other with implacable hatred.</p>
               <p>MAHOMET, (ſonne of <hi>Abdar</hi> a Pagan, and <hi>Emma</hi> a Jew) was borne at <hi>Iathreb</hi> (or <hi>Itrarip, Iezrab</hi> in <hi>Postellus,</hi> now <hi>Medyna</hi>) in <hi>Arabia,</hi> the yeere from the Creation 4544, of Chriſt our bleſſed Lord and Saviour 574: <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi> at that time commanding the Roman Empire, and <hi>Cozrhoes</hi> (father to <hi>Hormizda</hi>) the Perſians.</p>
               <p>His parents being mean and poore, he was forced to ſerve an appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip, and with much patience ſerved <hi>Zayed-ben-Hartah</hi> a rich and famous Merchant; who dying, left his ſervant ſo good a legacie, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was thought worthy any woman in <hi>Mecca:</hi> but by reaſon of thoſe inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant broyles commenc't by <hi>Cozrhoe</hi> and inflamed by the Romans, Traffick decayed, and moſt men danc't to the ſhrill brazen ſound of <hi>Bellonaes</hi> mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; <hi>Mahomet</hi> amongſt the reſt ſerving for pay firſt with <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and then the Perſian; not caring much who was victor, ſo he was on the ſafeſt ſide, by both their confuſion to plot ſome way or other to advance himſelfe, both in a terrhen dignity and as a Deity: nor did he erre in his prediction; for what by his great eſtate and good fortune in the warres, he ſoone threw off the qualitie of a common man, and got a companie; yea at length an Armie of ſo many Tattars and Arabians, that he dared to aſſault the infeebled Chriſtians, and became victor; yea, by ſtratagem (mingling with the credulous and gladded Perſians) upon a watch-word cut aſunder and confounded the Perſian Armie. Which done, hee bluſht not to extoll himſelfe to all his troops, deciphering the miſery of <hi>Perſia</hi> and horror of <hi>Roman</hi> bondage; acquainting them alſo with the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord 'mongſt Chriſtians; of that inhumane villanie perpetrated upon <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi> by <hi>Phocas</hi> (then Emperour) his deteſted ſervant, and of Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face's</hi> uſurpation of the title of Univerſall Biſhop; contrary to the good will of all the World, and what Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the great had lately bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Iohn</hi> the Conſtantinopolitan Patriack with, as the Antichriſt; in that ſixtie ſix good Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Lynus</hi> (ſeven yeeres after the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to that Pope then teaching, never deſired it. That hee himſelfe was
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:20354:132"/>
ordained from the begining of the world to eclipſe the pride of that Pope, to inſtruct the world in a better and more plauſible way than either <hi>Moſes</hi> did the Jewes, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Chriſtians; that hee was the Comforter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed (yet ſayes that he came to give his Law by the ſword and not by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles) and to advance the Arabians name and dignitie above all other Kingdomes in the Univerſe. The amazed Savages admire his boldneſſe, and (though ſome thought baſely of him) moſt part hoping hee could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his promiſes, give credit to him and atttend his revelations.</p>
               <p>But ere he could finiſh his new moulded work, the inraged Perſian ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſteales among them and in memory of their late kindneſſe, retaliates them ſo fiercely, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> (to ſave his life) poſts away, leaving the reſt to the mercileſſe furie of the Perſian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> with a ſad heart arrives ſafely in <hi>Mecca</hi> (<hi>Mocura</hi> and <hi>Muny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiates</hi> in old writers, the Arabian Metropolis:) but when he cals to mind his miſerable eſtate, by this laſt defeat being cheated of his moneys and men, yea ſuch men as hee had prepar'd to help forwards his ambition, hee conſumes in the meditation, and by his faint-heartedneſſe and conſtant vexing had doubtleſſe made Death his executioner, had not Satan phyſicke him.</p>
               <p>Some ſafer way he intends to take, than in <hi>Mars</hi> his rugged fields, ſo full of coſt and blood-ſhed.

               <p>The Alcorar is a miſcellany of other prodigious things.

The other Azoaraes of his <hi>Kurrawn</hi> are of Arithmetick, fights, dangers, truth, falſhood, tyranny, warre, peace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, &amp;c. The 85 Azoara treats of the Zodiac; the 90 of the Sunne; the 91, 92, 93, of the Moon, of night, of morn; the 113, of the Firmament; but is Philoſophy of ſuch courſeneſſe that I may well ſay, <hi>Diſcum potius quam Philoſophum:</hi> for how can it well be otherwiſe, ſince in his 17 Azoara, hee confeſſes that hee could neither read nor write; but that all his learning was ſuper-naturall. In one chapter hee is bold to ſay, that <hi>Solomon</hi> was a great Magician, and that hee learnt it from <hi>Marot</hi> and <hi>Arot,</hi> two great black Devills: with more reaſon we may ſay, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was skild in that infernall wiſdome, if halfe of thoſe miracles bee true hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of himſelfe; one is this: In a great aſſembly of Arabian Pagans, he pointed at the Moone with his thumb and long finger; it ſeemes it knew his mind, for the Moone immediatly clove aſunder, and in two peeces fell upon the hill of <hi>Mecca,</hi> on which hee at that time ſtood: <hi>Mahomet</hi> with a peece of his linſey-wolſey coat patcht it and made it whole againe; and after it had alſo (ſay the Perſians) circumvolved <hi>Mortis Ally</hi> in way of imbrace or complement, it re-aſcended, and from that day became the badge or coat armour of all Boſarmen. In another, hee aſſures his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites, that <hi>Mecca, Medina,</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> be holy Cities, built by <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradize, but fram'd in heaven: &amp; thence it is, that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is by Turks as well as Chriſtians, honoured: foure Cities ſprung out of hell at the birth of <hi>Mahomet</hi> (at which, time all Idolls fell, and <hi>Lucifer</hi> was throwne into hell, ſo deep into that abiſſe, as hee was ſome yeeres ere he could get up againe) the names of thoſe devilliſh Townes are (as pleaſes <hi>Mahomet</hi> to ſay) <hi>Elmedin</hi> in <hi>Caldea, Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria, Vaſtat</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Eh-beram</hi> in <hi>Armenia:</hi> Places, it ſeemes which had refuſed him and his learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

Angells, and Saints; of judgement, the reſurrection, joy and paine, &amp;c. of which I will afford you a compendium for Muſſulmen to beleeve, for us to laugh at. One eve (as <hi>Mahomet</hi> was ſporting privatly in's chamber at <hi>Mecca,</hi> with <hi>Ayſce</hi> his young wife) <hi>Gabryel</hi> (<hi>Seraphyel</hi> the Perſians call him, the ſame that foſterd <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Ally</hi> three yeares, and was perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſuch a <hi>Malus Genius</hi> as haunted <hi>Brutus</hi>) in a flaſh of fire entred their bed-chamber, and ſaluted <hi>Mahomet</hi> with this meſſage: Haile thou beloved man! I come to fetch thee: the God whom thou ſo zealouſly worſhippeſt, deſires to ſee thee at his owne ſtation. <hi>Mahomet</hi> rejoyces, and going to mount upon the Angells wings (of which hee had ſeventy p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire) is hindred: he asks which way he ſhould take towards heaven, the Angel ſhewes him a huge Aſſe, <hi>Albarack</hi> by name, and bids him mount upon him; which <hi>Mahomet</hi> eſſaying could not doe, till hee had prayed for him. From <hi>Mecca</hi> hee poſted (in the twinckling of an eye, for <hi>Barack</hi> at foure ſteps had done it) to <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> there, the Angell diſmounted him, and took him into his owne protection. In few minutes <hi>Mahomet</hi> aſcended heaven, and was let in by <hi>Gabryel</hi> the Porter there. From one heaven to another is a travell of five hundred yeares; howbeit,<note place="margin">The Heaven</note> 
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> glanc't through the ſeven in a moment. In all which Orbs hee ſaw many ſtrange things; but firſt take notice what mettall the Orbs are made of. The firſt is of refined ſilver, and wherein all the glittering ſtarres are fixt with chains of burniſht braſſe: in this heaven he ſaw a Cock ſo great that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Moon, his cox-comb reacht into the imperiall heaven, many millions of miles altitude: every time that this Cock crowed, all other Chanticlears upon earth, re-ecchoed him. The ſecond heaven is of gold, ſuch gold as has beene ſeven times tried in the fire. The third is of pearle; in this heaven hee ſaw innumerable troops of Saints and Angells; each of them ſaluted him by his name, and he prayed for them. Amongſt the reſt he took notice of <hi>Adam, Enoch, Abraham, Samuel, David, Salomon,</hi> &amp;c. all whom he knew by revelation; and of which, ſome he taxed, others hee commended as occaſion ſerved him. The fourth heaven, is of Smaragd, and where he ſaw infinite companies of other Angells who made a mighty noiſe and inceſſantly praiſed God: and well they might make a noiſe, for (ſayes <hi>Mahomet</hi>) every Angell there, was a thouſand times bigger than the globe of the earth; and each had ten thouſand heads; every head, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten thouſand tongues; and every tongue praiſed God in ſeven hundred thouſand ſeverall languages: amongſt them, he noted one eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>Phatyr,</hi> or the Angell of Mercie; a creature of that vaſt frame that every ſtep he trod was twelve times more than the diſtance is twixt both the Poles. <hi>Mahomet</hi> inquired of him why he wept ſo fiercely; the Angell replied, that it was out of his compaſſion to ſee the deplorable eſtate and vanity of man. This is that ſame Angell that has the Holy Quill or pen in keeping; a pen of orient Pearle; ſo long, that an excellent Arabian Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer in five hundred yeeres continuall galloping, can hardly reach to the further end of it: with this pen, God regiſters all things paſt, preſent, and to come; the Inck he writes with, is pure Light; the Character ſo miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that none but he and <hi>Seraphael</hi> can underſtand it. All the hundred and foure holy Books are written by this Quill; <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe ten which <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:20354:137"/>
received; <hi>Seth</hi> had fifty; <hi>Edris</hi> (or <hi>Enoch</hi>) thirty; and <hi>Abraham</hi> had the reſt: it alſo writ <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes; Chriſts Goſpell, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi> Alcoran. The fifth heaven was of Diamonds: where hee ſaw a mighty Angell, and of all others the wiſeſt: hee had as many heads and tongues and voyces as any two others had in the inferior Orbe; and had the keeping of that Book, wherein all men in the world have their names written: he did nothing but turne over the leaves and blot out one name or another, for by that (as by the arrow of death) they died ſuddenly. The ſixth was of Turquoiſſe; the Seventh of Alahal; (ſome interpret it fire; others, pure light or breath congealed.) All theſe circumvove one another like Pearles or Onyous; but herein is the miracle, they be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucent and yet of mettalls: a rare Philoſophy! above all, is the heaven of heavens, full of light and ſilence: immenſe, and within which, all other bodies are compriſed, but it incomprehended: there <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſaw the throne of God, rich beyond expreſſion: very great alſo, for it was ſupported by ſeven Angells, each of them ſo wonderfully great, that a Faulcon if he were to flie a thouſand yeeres inceſſant flight, could ſcarce go ſo far, as is the diſtance of one eye from another: about the Throne hung foureteene candles, everlaſtingly burning: the length of every of thoſe candles (as <hi>Mahomet</hi> meaſured) was from one end to another as much ſpace as a good horſe can ride in five hundred yeeres: there hee ſaw the Almighty, who bad him welcome, and laid his hand upon <hi>Mahomets</hi> face: his hands (ſayes this blaſphemous deluder) were a thouſand times colder than Ice: for all which, <hi>Mahomet</hi> in ſhame of his owne baſeneſſe, bluſht for ſhame, and ſwet with feare; but with his long finger hee ſwept away the ſweat from his brow, and threw it into Paradiſe: rare ſweat! Each drop (he notes them to be ſix) turn'd into ſome rare thing or other: one drop into a Roſe, another into a graine of Rice; the other foure into foure learned men, <hi>Ac'met, Sembelin, Abuhamed, Melec-zed,</hi> and <hi>Seh-vaffin;</hi> After hee had ſufficiently inſtructed himſelfe in many myſteries, and was aſſured of Gods favour, he deſcended with his Alcoran: but how he got it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, how notoriouſly it has blaſted the earth and poyſoned moſt parts and Iles of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africk;</hi>

Paradiſe (ſayes the Alcoran) is ſo many miles about as there be moats or atoms in the Sunne: It is incloſed with a wall of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times refined gold; ten thouſand miles high, and in thickneſſe about three thouſand: It has alſo ſeven gates to enter in at (ſeven is a myſterie;) of Carbuncle or pureſt Rubie is the firſt gate; the other ſix be of Pearle, of Emrald, of Turquoyſe, of Hiacinth, of Smarag'd, and of Amariſt; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reflecting upon the ſpheares.

For ſo ſoone as he heard of the maſſacre of <hi>Mauritius,</hi> his wife and children, by <hi>Phocas</hi> a Captaine in his Armie; and of the arrogance of <hi>Boniface</hi> the Romiſh Biſhop, who at that time aſſumed the title of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Biſhop, he rejects <hi>Lilius</hi> the Roman Ambaſſ. &amp; Apoſtatiſes; yea vowes to ſacrifice himſelfe in <hi>Mauritius</hi> his quarell, or be revenged on that villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Phocas:</hi> and thence-forward he revives his Pagan titles; in all his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and proclamations beginning thus, <hi>Coſrhoes King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Ruler of princes, Salvation of men,</hi> &amp;c. By ſuch his blaſphemie he hoped to aſſure his owne he was once more a Pagan. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 603 with an Armie of 100000 men he entred <hi>Syria;</hi> there, in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Phenicia</hi> doing all the miſchiefe imaginable. All the leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> parched in his inflamed furie: hee harried the poore Chriſtians as farre as <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> takes <hi>Capeſſa</hi> and <hi>Edyſſa. Anno Dom.</hi> 612 hee heares of the untimely deaths of <hi>Narſes</hi> and <hi>Phocas</hi> his enemies, beheaded by <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour. That yeare

alſo he ſackt <hi>Apamea, Ceſaria, Cappadocia, &amp;c.</hi> but at <hi>Antioch</hi> is overjoyed with a victorie he obtain'd againſt the Chriſtians: This encouraged him to over-runne <hi>Paleſtyne, Ieruſalem</hi> alſo, where hee derided <hi>Zacharius</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch and transferd the Croſſe thence to <hi>Shyraz</hi> in <hi>Perſia:</hi> hee ſubdued <hi>Aegipt</hi> alſo, <hi>Alexandriae,</hi> and <hi>Lybia;</hi> and made the blackt fac't Aethiopians admire his frenzie. The Roman Empire had reaſon to be affrighted, when they felt his wrath in <hi>Anatolia,</hi> chiefly in <hi>Ancyra</hi> the Galatian Metropolis. 'Tis reported that in that out-breaking he ſlew 300000 Chriſtians; agran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz'd by the Jewes who followed him, and payd readie money for many Chriſtians, whom without mercie they ſlaughtered. <hi>Heraclius</hi> ſent 70 Roman Gentlemen to mediate Peace; <hi>Saes</hi> the Perſian Generall threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them as ſpies, and barbarouſly beat them back againe. <hi>Heraclius</hi> is ſo impatient at that high indignitie, as with a good number of men he fought with <hi>Saes</hi> and gets the victorie: <hi>Saes</hi> for his payment is by <hi>Coſrhoes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand flayed alive, and <hi>Sarbaeras</hi> made Generall. <hi>Heraclius</hi> Winterd in the Pontique Regions, <hi>Sarbaras</hi> with a monſtrous Armie paſſes through <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and one Moone-ſhine night aſſayled the Romans whom he thought to have found unprepared: but by that haſte loſt 50000 of his men, and gave a brave encouragement to the Chriſtians. <hi>Coſrhoe</hi> next yeare ſent <hi>Sarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſa</hi> to trie his fortunes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heraclius</hi> requires a truce, but <hi>Coſrhoes</hi> vowes revenge, and never to reſt vexing the Chriſtians. And to that end ſends <hi>Sathyn</hi> into <hi>Trepizond,</hi> but at <hi>Azotus, Heraeclius</hi> affronted him, and had the victorie. At <hi>Gazacot, Cozrhoes</hi> dares the Roman Emperour with an Armie of 50000 Perſians: never was battell better fought nor more doubtfully; but at length the Perſians flie away, yea <hi>Coſrhoes</hi> upon a ſwift Arabian Courſer poſts to <hi>Theobatman,</hi> hoping there if any where to finde ſafetie. But ſuch was the generall hate he had plunged himſelfe into, that he diſtruſts that Santua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. <hi>Heraclius</hi> reſolves to ferrit him, but <hi>Coſrhoes</hi> hearing of his approach, thinks it more ſafe to flie away than looke for help from that helpleſſe Deity. <hi>Heraclius</hi> when he had throughly ſearched that idolatrous place and could not find him, is ſorrie; but rejoyces againe that his Deaſtri were there to execute his wrath on. The people, ſome he ſlew, the reſt he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: the Flamens he ſacrificed to their Idoll, the Pyree he incinerated, and made other common fire be commixt with that they boaſted they had from heaven, and together made it conſume the whole Citie into aſhes: at <hi>Gazacot</hi> alſo hee did the like where was another Pyree infinitly reſorted to by thoſe Idolaters. An abomination taught them by <hi>Zertooſt</hi> in King <hi>Guſtaſps</hi> time, and ſeemes to mee either that which <hi>Moſes</hi> forbad the Iſraelites, that they ſhould not let their ſeed (or children) paſſe through the fire to <hi>Moloch</hi> (which ſome think was a brazen hollow heated Statua) or as the Sepharuites practis'd, of whom 'tis ſaid, that they burnt their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the fire to <hi>Adrammeleck</hi> and <hi>Anammelec,</hi> the Gods of <hi>Sephervaim,</hi> as is in <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.21. and in the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.17. and 31. and concerning which Idolatry we read in <hi>Lucian, Strabo lib.</hi> 15. <hi>Procopius lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de bello Perſico, Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias lib.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Amongſt other things which <hi>Heraclius</hi> found there in that Temple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Sun, was one Deaſter or image of <hi>Coſrhoes,</hi> which the people
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:20354:144"/>
worſhipped: the frame was round, reſembling heaven; his head was wreathed with the Sun; the rayes ſpread themſelves to the umbelique or navell of the image: on one ſide was the Sun againe depicted, on th'other the Moone and Starres, his brother and ſiſters; and under his feet, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with Crownes and Scepters, attending him: bat albeit the work was rare and the materiall of refined gold; yet did the good Emperour throw, it into the fire to incorporate it with his Diety. <hi>Coſrhoes</hi> by this had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a freſh Armie out of <hi>Hyrcarnia,</hi> and bids <hi>Shae-Rablecca</hi> to forrage <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania:</hi> but they ſtood ſo excellently upon their defence that <hi>Rablacca</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes till <hi>Sarbaras</hi> with new forces forc't him back; and much hurt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe had they done had not <hi>Heraclius</hi> ſpeedily entred and rooted them both in one day, yet neither knowing it. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Prophet was in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racliu's</hi> Armie till now: and about this time begins the Hegyra or flight of that falſe Prophet from <hi>Mecca,</hi> whoſe people threatned to kill him for his innovation and doctrine. <hi>Anna Dom.</hi> 622 and of the Emperours reigne 13, <hi>Sarbaras</hi> paſt his Armie over <hi>Euphrates</hi> of purpoſe to trie the fortune of warre with <hi>Heraclius:</hi> who ſo ſoone as hee knew his intent gave him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repent his arrogance: the good Emperour himſelfe diſcharging his duty ſo excellently &amp; with ſuch excellent courage, that <hi>Sarbaras</hi> upon view of it cryed out thus to <hi>Coſma</hi> his Companion, O <hi>Coſmal</hi> ſeeſt thou with what courage the Emperour fights? certainly hee alone is able to vanquiſh all our multitudes. That Winter the Emperour marched to <hi>Sebaſtia,</hi> and croſſing the river <hi>Halys</hi> made <hi>Paphlagonia</hi> his rendezvous. But <hi>Coſrhoe</hi> ſwels with paſſion, and combines with Lucifer, that by diabolicall Witchcraft he might vex the miſerable Chriſtians, againſt whom hee raged with all ſorts of cruelty: and ere he gave a farewell to this world, once more ventures a battell with the Romans: 150000 men he muſters up, and divides them in three; to <hi>Sayn</hi> one part, to <hi>Serbaras</hi> another, to himſelfe the reſt: ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining by ſome or all of theſe to doe wonders. <hi>Sayn</hi> with his 50000 went againſt the Emperour. <hi>Sarbaras</hi> with his 50000 marcht to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> and <hi>Coſrhoe</hi> ſtayes upon the frontiers. <hi>Heraclius</hi> divides his alſo into three; the one to haſten into <hi>Thrace,</hi> the other to beſtow a Camiſado upon <hi>Sayns</hi> Quarter, the laſt hee led himſelfe into the Lazic Territories: to which place the Gazarrs (a ſort of Turk) came to ſerve him: <hi>Theodore</hi> in ſmall time rais'd <hi>Sayns</hi> Armie, his Chryſolocae; aſſiſted by hayle from heaven, ſo direfully thundring on them, that all men there, ſaw that God fought for them. <hi>Sayn</hi> was a ſlaine in that battell; but in ſtead of a decent buriall, the Perſian Tyrant array'd his carcaſſe in raggs, perſumed him with dogs turds, and ſlaſht his ſenceſſe trunck into a thouſand peeces. That yeare the Gazarrs (to gratifie <hi>Heraclius</hi>) under conduct of <hi>Ziebit</hi> broke through the Caſpian ſtraits, and did the Perſians much miſchiefe, and to the Roman Armie expreſt no ſmall affection. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 626 <hi>Sarbaras</hi> with infinit troopes entred <hi>Thrace,</hi> pillg'd <hi>Calcedon,</hi> a towne built by <hi>Iaſon</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias,</hi> much traded to, in view of <hi>Byſanth</hi> and upon the <hi>Boſpherus.</hi> After that, they layd ſiege to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and for ten dayes, inceſſantly laboured to enter it: but ſuch was the excellent courage of the Chriſtians, ſuch her naturall defence, that the Perſians could not prevaile; but upon notice that <hi>Heraclius</hi> was approching, they rais'd their ſiege &amp; retreated ſhamfully.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:20354:144"/>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 628. the Roman Emperour entred <hi>Armenia,</hi> and in a long fought battell obtained a mervailous great victorie. After which, hee demoliſht <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> and purſued <hi>Coſrhoe:</hi> who when he heard that <hi>Sarbaras</hi> had ſped but ill in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and had re-delivered <hi>Caloedon</hi> to the Chriſtians, inflamed with paſſion he ſends a villain an Aſſaſſinate to murther him: but by ſtrange hap the Emperors ſonne had notice of it and acquaints the Generall; who by this ingratitude of <hi>Coſrhoe</hi> begun to raiſe a dangerous rebellion. <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoes</hi> when he ſaw things ſucceeded thus infortunatly, in anguiſh of ſoule breath'd out his ſpirit: a Fever firſt, and then a Flux ſo taking him, that after he had reigned 50 yeares, upon his death-bed he nominated, as King his ſonne <hi>Mardeſae</hi> begot of <hi>Syra</hi> his Queene; who ere hee could ſet the Crowne on's head, was ſlaine by <hi>Syroes</hi> his brother, yea before his fathers face: an act ſo horryd that <hi>Coſrhoe</hi> bitterly curſes him; but <hi>Syroes</hi> (the moſt bloudie viper that ever liv'd) heaps greater ſinnes upon his head, by commanding ſome villains to ſhoot him to death: at that inſtant his loathed ſoule call'd to mind his like cruelty to <hi>Hormiſda</hi> his father, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that God was juſt to his retaliation.</p>
               <p>So ſoone as <hi>Heraclius</hi> heard of <hi>Coſrhoes</hi> death, he imagines all his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells ended: that yeare therefore he travell'd to the holy Citie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>Zacharyas</hi> the then Patriarch with the Croſſe of Chriſt, found by Saint <hi>Helena</hi> (a Brittaniſh Lady) 3 May 326. and raviſht thence by <hi>Coſrhoes</hi> as I lately remembered. His triumphant entring thither was the 17 of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 628: the ſame yeare that <hi>Boniface</hi> publiſhed to the world his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Supremacie; and in which, <hi>Mahomet</hi> divulg'd his Alcoran.</p>

During this, <hi>Heraclius</hi> dyed, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 640, after 30 yeeres rule, and in's place <hi>Heracl; Conſtantinus</hi> ſucceeded, who in the 7 month of his Empire was poyſoned by <hi>Martina</hi> his ſtep-Dome, and <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clionas</hi> her ſoone advanced: but were forthwith both of them exiled by the people, their noſes and tongues cut out; and <hi>Conſtans</hi> ſaluted Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in his place.</p>

The Perſians honoured him, the Armenians loved him, but the Jewes deified and aſſured him hee was the Meſſias they ſo long wayted for: but <hi>Iſmaels</hi> ſeverity towards them upon that blaſphemie, made them quickly recant, and rather think him a ſecond <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> Ere I goe further, let mee ſpeake a word of his ſirname <hi>Sophy.</hi>

                  <hi>Iſmael</hi> at his Coronation proclaim'd himſelfe King of <hi>Perſia</hi> name of <hi>Pot-Shaw-Iſmael-Sophy.</hi> Whence that word <hi>Sophy</hi> was borrowed, is much controverted. Whether it be from the Armenian idiom, ſignifying wooll, of which the Shaſhes are made that enobled his new order. Whether the name was from <hi>Sophy</hi> his Grandſire, or from the Greek word <hi>Sophos</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon <hi>Aydar</hi> at his conqueſt of <hi>Trepizond</hi> by the Greeks there, I know not. Since then many have called the Kings of <hi>Perſia, Sophy's:</hi> but I ſee no proper reaſon for it; ſince <hi>Iſmaels</hi> ſonne, grand great grand ſons Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> never continued that name, till this that now reignes, whoſe name indeed is <hi>Soffee,</hi> but caſuall.</p>

Which done, he haſts back to <hi>Yezd,</hi> hearing that <hi>Mahomet</hi> had beſieged it: he quickly raiſ'd the ſiege and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And after hee had compounded ſome differences 'twixt himſelfe and <hi>Morod-ſha,</hi> brother to <hi>Alvan; Anno Dom.</hi> 1507. <hi>Heg.</hi> 887, hee journeyed to <hi>Shyraz</hi> where he was ſolemnly crowned: but next day put to death 30000 men, ſuch as were either guilty of his Fathers death, or had taken part with <hi>Morod</hi> againſt him. That yeare he haſtened into <hi>Moſendram</hi> and repuls'd the Tartarrs, albeit he had not above 20000 horſe, and <hi>Vlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> and his were above 300000. And to retaliate them he billited his men that Winter in <hi>Taron;</hi> but ſo ſoone as the weather permitted hee entred <hi>Tuzz,</hi> intending to ſpoile <hi>Samarchand.</hi> But hearing of <hi>Sultan Ocen's</hi> death, and that <hi>Shac-beg-chawn</hi> an <hi>Ouz-beg,</hi> had uſurped the Crowne of <hi>Coraſan;</hi> in the behalfe of ther injur'd Princes <hi>Ocens</hi> ſonnes, he entered <hi>Coraſan;</hi> and in a long fought battell 'twixt him and the Rhumeſtans, ſlew <hi>Sha-beg-cawn,</hi> 30000 Tattars, and made <hi>Acen-Ally</hi> be crowned King; upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that at his death it ſhould hold of the Perſian Dyadem.

and when he had fully glutted himſefe amongſt the Tartarrs, came joyfully back to <hi>Coom,</hi> where he was received with all ſymptoms of joy poſſible to be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Next ſommer he went into <hi>D'arbeg</hi> againſt the Turks, who ſo ſoone as they had heard of <hi>Iſmaels</hi> doings in Tartary entred <hi>Bagdat</hi> and expreſt their utmoſt villanie there; calling them Raffadins or Schiſmaticks, and cutting off the noſes and thumbs of many hundred Perſians.

That ſame night he was alſo aſſaulted in his tent by his inraged Country-men; who in his place, (for at the firſt alarme he eſcaped) cut a Catamite in peeces, his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed bed-fellow: and albeit hee ſo farre exaſperated the Perſian to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, that he brought the whole Army into <hi>Georgia,</hi> reſolving there to act unparellel'd tragedies; yet was hee over-reacht in his ſtratagems: for upon parlee with the Queen (his late brothers wife) he was ſhot to death, at a private ſignall given by that Amazon to ſome Muſqueteers, ambuſhed of purpoſe 'twixt both the Armies.

               <p>But <hi>Abbas</hi> (glad of all advantages to ſpoyle and conquer) takes the affront as done in his deſpight, in that <hi>Conſtandell</hi> was his ſubject and a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan; and therefore ſtudies their deſtruction: but ſuch good reaſons <hi>Ally-cawn</hi> gave him to the contrary, that hee alters his firſt intents, and ſeekes by conferring his beſt love upon young <hi>Temerisk</hi> their Infant King to oblige their affection: and accordingly returned him into <hi>Georgia</hi> roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attended, yea made him bee crowned King in <hi>Georgia,</hi> with all cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony requirable. But long theſe Halcyon dayes endured not; for the Grand Seniors Ambaſſador at <hi>Spahawn</hi> laboured by all wayes how to ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this their Union; &amp; by deceit effected it: Firſt wiſpering in <hi>Temerisks</hi> eares that <hi>Abbas</hi> hated him; and then made <hi>Abbas</hi> beleeve that <hi>Temerisk</hi> was an undoubted creature of the Grand Seniors: ſo that (upon <hi>Temerisks</hi> deniall to come to <hi>Abbas</hi>) he enters <hi>Georgia</hi> with 30000 horſe, where <hi>Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-beg,</hi> at his Maſters command, made fire and ſword equally tyrannicall. <hi>Temerisk</hi> was forced to the Turk, from whom he got ſuch forces, that hee re-entred <hi>Georgia,</hi> and ſlew the Perſique Garriſons, yea forraged beyond <hi>Tephlys</hi> into <hi>Medya:</hi> which ſo inraged <hi>Abbas</hi> that from <hi>Moſendram</hi> he iſſued with a greater Army than formerly, and in <hi>Georgia</hi> made a more terrible execution: firing their Churches, houſes, and Mulberry-trees; deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſilk-wormes, and maſſacring young and old, without mercy. But ſo ſoone as <hi>Abbas</hi> was gone, <hi>Temerisk</hi> re-poſſeſſed his deſolate Countrey; and by a ſtratagem of <hi>Morad-cawns,</hi> in ſome ſort requited the Perſian: for <hi>Morad</hi> like another <hi>Zopyrus,</hi> deformes his face, flies to <hi>Cazbyn,</hi> and is welcomed: pretends that <hi>Temerisk</hi> had ſo mutilated him; and that hee reſolved to betray him to the Perſian. <hi>Abhas</hi> beleeves him, and ſends 12 famous Dukes and an Army along with him: but being upon the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian Confines, and knowing that the Perſians were feareleſſe of danger, he iſſues at midnight from his owne quarter upon them with 500 volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Georgians (whom hee had appointed ſhould accidentally proffer
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:20354:151"/>
their ſervices) with ſuch hideous clamours, that 11 of thoſe Dukes and 700 men were ſlaine; the reſt ſo terribly affrighted, that they rather choſe to dye any other death than hazard any more adventures amongſt thoſe Chriſtians. Since which, <hi>Abbas</hi> (by meditation of his Coſel-baſhaws, who are moſt of them Georgians) has firmed a ſure friendſhip with the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould but memoriſe his ſeverall victories againſt the Tartar, Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, Mogull, and Arabian; It would be enough to make a Book volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. But I promiſed to weave no circumſtances: for if that could have beene accepted of, I had here alſo ſpoke his journey and warres of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> and his tragick acts againſt his own children: which in regard I have elſewhere glanced at, I have here pretermitted purpoſely; this only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; That <hi>Sha-Abbas</hi> dyed <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1628. <hi>Heg.</hi> 1008. aged 70, having ruled the Perſian Empire 43 yeeres; and was buried, part at <hi>Caz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byn,</hi> part at <hi>Ardaveel,</hi> in the Chappell where are intombed his famous and warlike Progenitors: And albeit in the infancy of his reigne he had beene Tyrannicall, yet ſuch was the Majeſty of his aſpect, his courage, policy, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; good fortune in all his wars, that never any Prince before him was better beloved, and every way by all Symptoms of Duty and reſpect, more honoured. His Care to adminiſter Juſtice; his Zeale to Strangers, whom he ever much regarded, and gave all ſafety and priviledges to; it beeing his uſuall phraſe, that Strangers added eſpecially to the luſtre of his Court, more than any Domeſtiq' magnificence; his Labour to increaſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with other Nations; his Incouragement to Souldiers; his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to Merchants of his owne Nation; and in a word, his great Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Hiſtory and Philoſophy, not only made him to bee adored by his owne, but admired at by Travellers; eſpecially when with him they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared other Emperours and Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who ſuck with delight their native ignorance: and thence it was that <hi>Abbas</hi> went to his grave, with ſuch generall lamentation as made it known that he was their Father, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and Emperour.</p>
               <p>In his place was <hi>Sha-Soffy</hi> (<hi>Abbas</hi> his Grand-ſonne) ſaluted King; whoſe fathers death and his brothers I have elſewhere remembred.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Sha-Soffy</hi> I will ſay little, ſave that ſince his being King (albeit very young) hee has vanquiſht the Turks 4 times: albeit twice the Grand-Seignior was in perſon to fight with him. Many of his Nobles hee has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed: but in theſe things argues his juſt diſcent from <hi>Ally:</hi> and is as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as any that reigned before him, to advance the Monarchy of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and every way to make it rich, and famous.</p>

            <p>The Bannyans in theſe parts are as ſuperſtitious as any other where, and arrogate as much vainglorious ceremony in their Funeralls: tranſcending in coſt and curioſity as the Carcaſſe differ'd ere-while from others in Eſtate and Quality: the richer ſort have redolent gums, or aromatick odours of <hi>Arabia</hi> incendiated or put to flames, wherein the dead body is laid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in linnen pure white, ſweet, and delicate; or in Taffataes of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent fineneſſe: of all ſorts of wood they affect that called <hi>Aquila,</hi> and the older kind nam'd <hi>Calamba;</hi> or <hi>Calambuca;</hi> trees, rare, ſweet, and pretious; of admirable height and evenneſſe, found commonly in the lofty Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Chaemoys</hi> in <hi>Cochyn-chyna;</hi> and which, theſe people ſell at exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive rates; both in regard the Bannians delight to have it in their Obſequies, as that the Japonians ſo much valew it. They imagine no pillow whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer, no thing more efficacious for health, than that to ſleep upon. They extreamly hate ſuch as have doun or what their heads may ſink into; both, for that it heats the blood, and pertubs the fancy: you now may view your fruits aſore you. I will ſelect the rareſt, and firſt preſent a ſhort deſcription: here are faire and juycy Lemons, Pappaes; Coco's, Bananas, or Plaintains, ſweet and delicious: the Orenges may tempt a taſt,<note place="margin">Orenges.</note> they are ſucculent and dainty, of ſo curious a reliſh as affects the eater beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and offer the rynd no leſſe pleaſant than the juyce, both which ſeeme to have dulcity &amp; acrimony mixt together. The Bannana's is no leſſe dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the tree mounts not high, but ſpreads in a moſt gracefull poſture: the fruit is long, not unlike a Soſſage in ſhape, in taſt moſt excellent:<note place="margin">Plantans</note> they ripen though you crop them immaturely; and from a dark-greene, mellow into a flaming yellow: the rynd peeles off very eaſily; the fruit put into your mouth, diſſolves and yeelds a moſt incomparable reliſh; the Windſor or Pome-crittien are to it farre inferiour.</p>

the Nayroes are his Lords; a ſort of Mamaluck; they live by the ſweat of other mens browes, luſt wholy maſters them; they goe no whither but are as well armed as if friends &amp; enemies had no difference. <hi>Maffaeus,</hi> improperly imagines them a kind of Braminy, to no ſort of people more unlike; the Bramyns being men of peace; the Nayro, ever quarelling: their armes are clad with Armolets of ſilver, or Ivorie; they walk no whither without ſword and target; and have ſuch a ſuperſtitious conceit of their owne merit and temper above other men, that whereſoere they meet a vulgar fellow, they clamour <hi>Nayro,</hi> vibrate and claſh their ſword and ſhield together, and ſo paſſe without oppoſall; but that no poore man dare looke them in the face or come within fifty paces of them, <hi>Thevet, Vertoman,</hi> and <hi>M. P. Venetus</hi> have ſo reported I know; but either the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes have altered, or I muſt call the one a deceitfull Monk, and the other two too credulous Travellers.</p>
               <p>The extent of <hi>Mallabar</hi> I have given you. The people generally are big limb'd, ſtrong, cole black, and weare their haire (more like wooll than haire) long, and curled; about their heads they wreath a ſmall but curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſort of lynnen wrought with gold and ſilk: their waiſt is circled with a peece of Callico, which makes them modeſt ; from the thigh downward, and from their middle upwards, are ſurely naked. The vulgar ſort weare about their waiſt a parti-coloured Plad (like Barbars Aprons) and pinck their skin in many places. The women (ſuch as credit <hi>Mahomet</hi>) vaile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like other Indyans: ſuch as affect gentiliſme covet nakedneſſce: their greateſt ornament and pride is in their eares and noſes; they ſuppoſe them moſt brave, moſt courtly, who can teare or dilacerate their eares wideſt (which they effect by many ponderous bables they hang there,) and ring their ſnouts with ſilver, braſſe, or Ivorie: their armes and leggs alſo are chained richly. The Ethnique marriages want not ſuperſtition: where God is not knowne, the devill invelopes and traines them up in myſtique darkneſſe: one ſame ceremonie is obſerved by King and Peſant. Whoever marries, he enjoyes not the firſt nights embraces with his Bride; a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cuſtome transferres all maydenheads unto the Braminy, who (to ſhew their obedience to the law) accept the motion and firſt ſeaſon her; it betides happineſſe ever after: they ſuppoſe the ground richer, the crop excellenter, which receives ſuch holy ſeed; and promiſes ſuch future Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts of contentedneſſe: no marvell then, to ſee a Prieſt enter where hee pleaſes, diſcourſe when and where he will, the good man joying at their privacie; ſince they are in apparition terrhene Idolls: But, which is more than marvellous, the King not knowing whether his children be of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting; to make ſure work, conferres the Empire on his ſiſters iſſue; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it ſeemes that ſhee is of his blood, and they of his by conſequence: a very ſimple Sophiſtry, grounded upon cuſtome more than reaſon.</p>
               <p>The men, what they want in Sciences, ſupply by a ſurpaſſing courage and pollicie; the Portugals at their firſt intrenching on their ſhore, thought them ſilly, becauſe unlearned; eaſie to be overcome, becauſe covered with an indefenſive nakedneſſe: but both conceits deceived them: they found (by ſad experience) Nature had inſtructed them in their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and that no Cannon nor iron is ſo violently dangerous as revenge

precipitated, exaſperated by contempt and where furie rageth: howbeit, by long warres, they are growne expert and orderly: yea know how to play with Cannons, have as great ſtore of Harquebuzes, and are as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the force of powder, as we or any other Nation: in all fights, they alſo uſe bow and arrow, darts and targets, granads and variety of fire-works; of which they have ſuch ſtore, that they proffered us as much and of what ſorts we would, ſo we returned them money. Their Country abounds with mineralls and ſtones of luſtre: no part is without abundance of fruits and proviſion: generally (eſpecially by the Sea) tis woody and mountanous. We will a-ſhore at <hi>Callicut</hi> the Metropolis.</p>
               <p>CALLICVT (ten leagues from that place wee tooke our prize) is thought to be that Towne <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls <hi>Canthapis,</hi> a Citie in 23 deg. an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror broacht by <hi>Niger</hi> and <hi>Bertius.</hi> It was above a thouſand yeares ago call'd <hi>Callicaris:</hi> was then knowne, but now is famous; and had beene of more trade and excellence, had ſhe proſperd againſt the continuall bravadoes of the Portugall: who when they fail'd to conquer her, (did with her as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuchus</hi> did with <hi>Babylon</hi>) transferr'd their trade to other Townes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted her Merchants to other places; whereby in ſmall time it became halfe deſolate. It declines from the Aequator towards the North-Pole, eleven degrees: and from its ſtanding in the burning Zone muſt needs be hot, if not ſulphureous: the earth is but meanly fruitfull in graſſe, <hi>Apollo</hi> eats it up; but, her gardens by induſtry and help of ſome brooks are green, ſpatious, and redundant in variety of choiſe fruits. The Citie it ſelfe is large, but of no beauty: the houſes are low, and thick, and dark: the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is a pretty way diſtant from the Town, and but indifferent to anchor in: it ſhewes two great Forts, built <hi>Anno</hi> 1515 by the Portuguiſe; unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and in a ſort raized by the Mallabar; the <hi>Samoreen</hi> or Emperour in this place uſually abiding: a Prince of great power and awe: black as the devill, and as treacherous: is alſo of his religion, and makes him heire to all his offrings. Many deformed Pagatho's are here worſshipped: they ſay they adore not the Idolls, but the Deumos they repreſent, and who ſometimes enter and Oraculize: the Chappel where the grand <hi>Caco-Deumo</hi> ſits is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and about three yards high; the wooden entrance is ingraven with infernall ſhapes: within, their beloved <hi>Priapus</hi> is imperiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throniz'd upon a brazen Mount: they advance his head with a reſplendent Dyadem, from whence iſſue foure great Rams hornes, denotating ſome eſpeciall myſterie: his eyes ſquint, his mouth opens like a Port-cullice, and from thence branch foure monſtrous tusks; his noſe is flat; his beard like the Sunnes rayes, of an affrighting aſpect; his hands are like the clawes of a Vulture; his thighes and legs, ſtrong and hayrie; his feet and taile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a Monkeys: which put together, renders the devill wickedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and the idolaters beyond all meaſure groſſe Demonomiſts: Other Temples have other Pagods; ugly, all: yet all differ in invention: ſome of them are painted or ſmeered black; others red: ſome bright; others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring ſoules; hell fictitiouſly tormenting white ones: Theſe Gods of theirs are of the old ſtamp: they ſeeme to threaten and to take notice of mens offrings: but what They cannot doe, their Baalyms effectuate. Each morne, the Prieſt (a Jogue) perfumes and waſhes them: it ſeemes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:20354:156"/>
ever pollutes and leaves a baſe ſmell behind him: he departs not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a benediction; humbly he proſtrates his corps and has it granted him. Every new Moone they ſolemnly ſacrifice a live Cock as a Symbol of luſt and courage; in themſelves predominating; the Prieſt is pontifically atty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in pure fine Lawne, arm'd with a ſharp long ſilver knife, his armes and leggs garniſht after the Moriſco mode with bells, round ſilver plates and other jangling trifles: after he has bravely ſacrific'd the yeelding Cock, he fills his hands with Ryce, goes retrograde, not daring to looke on any other object ſave his Idoll; till being come neere an Acherontique lake, he then turnes, there embowells his offring, advancing his hands ſome ſet times above his head, and ſo returnes crown'd with applauſe and bleſſed in other mens opinions. The Samoryn eats not till it be firſt offred, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges his food ſent him from the <hi>Deumo,</hi> i. e. by the devills permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: what he leaves, is not for the poore; the Crowes expect it: good reaſon too, They think them the Devils ſerviteurs. The people to this day retaine ſome commendable cuſtomes amongſt 'em: they commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their Wives one for anothers, nor ſeeme the women angry at it; Poligamy is ſufferable: but in this they differ from other libidinous Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers; as the men have many wives, ſo one woman may here have many husbands: the iſſue is bequeathed as ſhe nominates.</p>
               <p>COVVLAM is a Towne and Province (call'd <hi>Sopatpa</hi> in <hi>Arrhyan</hi>) in 9 degrees North, and included in the <hi>Travanzorian</hi> Kingdome. Once it obeyed the <hi>Narſingan</hi> Monarch; once the <hi>Mallabar;</hi> at this day, neither. 200 yeares agoe, the Towne was rich, and great, and populous; traded to by many Indyans, augmented by the Samoryn, and able to number a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand inhabitants: of ſuch value was the ſcituation for trade, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for anchorage, and fidelity of the Coolamites. But now, whither her glaſſe is runne, the period of her excellence out-runne; or that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut</hi> firſt, and then <hi>Goa</hi> have attracted her cuſtome and reſort, I cannot ſay; this I may: at this day ſhee is vailed with a ſable habit, deſolate and diſconſolate; ſhee contemplates the mutability of Times, and other's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters; and then comparing them with her owne, ſees they conclude in a like Center.</p>
               <p>And albeit I have in many places memoriz'd the Bannyans; here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I may name them, where they ſwarme in multitudes, and ſuck in the ſweetneſſe of gaine, by an immeaſurrble thirſt and induſtry; but (<hi>Sic vos non vobis</hi>) it is raviſht from them by Drones, the lawleſſe Moores and Gentiles, who Lord it over them. Alas! the Bannyan is no ſwaggerer, no royſter: he hates domineering and fighting, yea will ſuffer himſelfe to be fleec't by any man, rather than ſhed blood by any unhappy contention: they love no tumult, no innovation; but wiſh that all men were of their mind; that is to ſay, courteous in behaviour, temperate in paſſion, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in apparell, abſtemious in dyet; humble, mercifull, and ſo innocent, as not to undoe the ſillieſt vermin: doubting that if they ſhould deſtroy any living thing, thereby they might diſpoſſeſſe their parents or deare friends of a peacefull Manſion; but by eating ſuch, may peradventure devoure the ſoules of ſuch as once were deareſt to them. <hi>Ovids</hi> conceit is partly for them.</p>

In <hi>Perſia</hi> are many thouſand Chriſtians; in <hi>India</hi> a no leſſe multitude; compared indeed to other Idolaters, but a hand-full: yet that does not diſcourage them: 'tis better go to heaven alone, than to hell with an innumerable multitude: <hi>Arnobius</hi> of old times could ſay <hi>Nationibus cunctis nos ſumus Chriſtiani.</hi> In many marittim Townes of <hi>India,</hi> that name is honoured. In <hi>Meliapore, Narſinga, Coolan, Gucurran, Curigan, Bipur, Tanor, Battacala, Onor, Cranganor, Goa,</hi> and other places are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: yea, in many Indian Iles ſome are numbered: among Mahomitans they have freedome of conſcience from that <hi>Azoara</hi> in the Alcoran, That none are to be diſwaded from the religion they ſuckt from their cradle: amongſt Panyms, from that rule of Nature; Uſe others, as thou would'ſt others ſhould uſe thee. The Chriſtians in theſe parts differ in ſome things from us and the Papacie; yet retaine many principles of the Orthodox and Catholick doctrine: Lets enter their Temples. Their Churches are low and but poorely furniſhed; their vaſſalage will reach no further: whether from their ſubjection, or that (ſo the Temples of their bodies bee reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with vertue) the excellency of buildings conferre not holineſſe, I know not: neat they are, and ſweetly kept; matted, without ſeats, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of Images have ſome ſelect and uſefull texts of holy Writ obviouſly writ or painted. They aſſemble and haſte to Church each Lords day with great alacrity: at their entring they ſhut their eyes and contemplate the holineſſe of the place, the exerciſe they come about, and their owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe: as they kneele, they look towards the Altar or Table, neere which the Biſhop or Preiſt is ſeated, whom they ſalute with a low and humble reverence; who returnes his bleſſing by the up-lifting of his hands
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:20354:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and eyes: at a ſet houre they begin prayers, above two houres ſeldome continuing: firſt they have a ſhort generall confeſſion, which they follow the Prieſt in, and aſſent in an unanim Amen: then followes an Expoſition of ſome part or text of holy Scripture: during which, their attention, dejected lookes, and ſilence is admirable: they ſing an hymne, and at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of Church, re-ſalute the Miniſter; who ceaſes not (till all be gone out) to elate his hands and bleſſe them. When they are come home they read a chapter in either Teſtament, both which they ſuppoſe they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt after the Originalls, and tranſlated for them by Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle and patron of the Orient: they have it alſo in the Chaldy; but none ſave the Clergie underſtand it: every firſt Sonday in the Month, the Prieſt reads a Sermon out of an old Homily, writ (as they ſay) by the Apoſtle or ſome of his Diſciples: they Baptiſe commonly at the 40 day, if the Parents do no ſooner deſire it, they firſt ſigne the Infant on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with the Croſſe, and then waſh it all over with water: the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords holy Supper they adminiſter in both kinds; the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants receive it (reverently) kneeling: they obſerve two dayes ſtrict preparation, during which they eat no fleſh, revell not, accompanie with no women: in the Church they confeſſe their ſinnes and demerits with great reluctancy: They marry as wee do: the Clergie marry but once; the Layety but twice; widdowes if they marry before the yeere be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (after which their husbands dyed) are ill reported of, and hazard their joyncture: none (ſave for adultery) have lycence to part till death ſever them. In ſickneſſe the Prieſt is ſent for to comfort them, and to give the Euchariſt, if it bee heartily deſired: that done, they take farwell of their wife, and children, and all others; and ſo rid themſelves of carnall diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which too oft hinder the deſired meditation, of the miſery of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; and by a holy contemplation of the ineffable joyes of heaven, ſtrive to mitigate the pangs of their diſeaſe, yea the grim aſpect of approaching Death; and the ſurvivers rather joy than mourne as they ſolemnize his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: they firſt waſh, then wrap the Corps in clean linnen; &amp; a few ſelected friends concomitate it to the grave, wherein they place it looking (not Eaſt, but) Weſt towards <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> five dayes after that they viſit his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

The moſt memorable is this, That <hi>Meleck</hi> (or <hi>Melchior</hi>) <hi>Pyramal,</hi> King of this Iland is thought one of thoſe wiſe-men (premoniſht by that propheſy of <hi>Balaam</hi> the Edomite in <hi>Num.</hi> 24. 17.) that brought (as to a King, a Prieſt, a Prophet,) Gold, Frank-inſence, and Myrrh, unto our bleſſed Saviour; foretold alſo by the Perſian Sybill, and by a new made Starre guided by the finger of God, miraculouſly directed: and who at his returne made knowne the myſtery of Gods Incarnation, for mans redemption; &amp; by his laborious teaching made many Proſelites; ſome to this day by tradition memoriſing him, and reteining ſomewhat of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knowledge, though the greateſt part bee Apoſtats; and drunk with abominable demonomy and ſuperſtition.

They are various, the moſt Novell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a Prieſt, a Cow, and the two Lovers go together to the water ſide; where the Bramyn mutters a prayer of ſmal matter to ſome purpoſe; which finiſht, in order and Symmetry they linck hands, and have the Cowes tayle commixt as a holy teſtimony; on all together the Bramin powres his hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Oyle, and forces the beaſt into the river, whereinto ſhee goes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, yea ſo farre till they be to the middle in water; nor returnes ſhe, nor doe they diſunite, till <hi>Neptune</hi> fright her: but being on ſhore, they untie, holding that conjunction ſacred and powerfull ever after.</p>
               <p>Their Epithalamy is ſung, let's heare their Funeralls! when Death has cut in two their Union; ſhee conceits her ſelfe a loathed carkaſſe to live after him: ſhee roabs her tender body with a tranſparent Lawne; her armes, leggs, and thighes, are fettered with wanton chaines of love; her eares, nose, and fingers, adorn'd with Pearles and precious ſtones; one hand holds choiſe of flowers; th'other a Ball; Embleams of immortall Paradiſe. She goes attended with a mighty company; ſome for love, moſt for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty. The Prieſt all the way deſcribes the rare joyes ſhe is going to; ſhe grants a modeſt ſmile, trips on, and upon ſight of the flame, ſeemes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported beyond meaſure; ſhe ſees the carcaſſe of her Husband layd upon a pyle of pretious wood, and when the fire begins to embrace him, like a mad Lover ſhee bids Farwell to her Parents, children, and friends, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly incorporates her ſelfe with fire; which quickly makes them one, and nothing; nothing extant ſave fame, flame, and aſhes. Of which the Poët, thus of old.</p>

               <p>MELIAPORE, is a Town on the Coaſt of <hi>Kormandel,</hi> elevating the Artick Pole 13 degr. 20 min. both old and famous; firſt call'd <hi>Calamina,</hi> then, <hi>Melange, Meliapore</hi> after that, and now S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> by reaſon that in this place he ſuffered martyrdome.</p>
               <p>The Towne is at this day ſmall and poore; under Mooriſh command; and yeelds little for Trade, ſave Cotton ware and ſuch Commodities; howbeit, is exalted in her memory. This was the laſt place where the Apoſtle preached, after hee had converted <hi>Perſia, Hyrcania, Bactria, Sog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:20354:160"/>
and many parts of <hi>Indya,</hi> yea and many Proſelites were here, who embraced his ſoule ſaving doctrine, and thoſe not of the baſeſt ſort; for <hi>Sygamus</hi> himſelfe (Emperour of this Coaſt) was baptized, and (by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) other of the Nobles. Howbeit, the Devill ſo wrought (by Gods permiſſion) that ſome apoſt atizd and inraged the multitude, ſo that in a common furie they both ſuffered, the one was ſhot to death, the other brayned, and both crowned with glorious martyrdome, thirty yeares after our Saviours paſſion. And, however <hi>Abdias Babylonicus</hi> (who writ that after their deaths they appeared and preached againe their former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,) may ſeeme doubtfull, this is certaine that in Memory of their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ingatitude, the divine juſtice hath marked their poſterities, (as ſome Jewes ſay the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> are to this day, who of all others were moſt fierce againſt our Saviour of the Tribe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi>) ſo theſe have one leg as big againe in the calfe as is the other. Notwithſtanding the peoples rage, the two noble Martyrs had each his ſepulcher, and to this day was a receptory of many native and other holy Chriſtians; till about fiftie yeares ſince, their skulls and bones were brought a way and (as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relicks) at this day kept in the Virgins church in <hi>Ioa</hi>) by command of <hi>Iohn</hi> 3 of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who ſent <hi>Emanuel Frias</hi> (guided by <hi>Alphonſus Souſae</hi>) to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Many ſtrange reports I could give yee out of Spaniſh reporters, But I am not enjoyned to beleeve them. What is very obſervable and with warrant, I may. That in the yeare of our Lord God 883 (as <hi>Malmſbury, Glor.

I read alſo, that in the yeare of our Lord 1277, <hi>Myrangee</hi> an Atheiſt conquerd <hi>Narſinga</hi> and beyond this City, a man full of rapine and other impietie; yea ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opinionated of this relique and Tradition that havihg one yeare abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ryce and other graine, and roome enough to hoord it in, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning way and bravery no place would pleaſe him to put it ſave the holy Chappell, where prayers were inceſſantly made by many religious Chriſtians. They intreat him to refraine, by all ſubmiſſive meanes, but it ſpurs him on to a greater height of profaneneſſe, yea is infinitely glad it vexes them, by this ſuppoſing himſelfe to be thought a God (a Devill ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and to be worſhipped. But ſee Gods power and favour in it; that night, in an affrighting dreame or viſion he ſees the old Apoſtle approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in wrathfull and diſcontented way threatning to puniſh him for his ungodlineſſe, and with an Iron whip proffers to laſh the relenting King, who ſuddenly is a waked and as ſoone beſeeching the Chriſtians to pray for him, helping himſelfe to purge the houſe of God and ſatisfying for his ſacriledge. A Miracle not a little joying the ſad minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>

               <head>Of Narſinga.</head>
               <p>NARSlNGA, is a Noble part of <hi>India</hi> where ſome would have <hi>Chormandell</hi> to terminate, but I like it not. <hi>Narſinga</hi> is famous all over <hi>Aſia:</hi> confined by <hi>Mallabar, Gulcunda, Bengala</hi> (<hi>Baracura</hi> of old,) and the Ocean. The King ſo rich, that he deſpiſes his Neighbours: ſo powerfull in Men, Armes, and Ammunition; that hee values neither Mogul, Decan, Samoryn, nor Peguan. His Kingdomes are defended by loyall ſlaves, and many naturall advantages; full of all things requiſite, for uſe, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: as faire Townes, ſtrong Forts, pleaſant fields, and choiſeſt Mineralls; abounding in rivers, hills, dales, corne, cattell, fruit, &amp;c. ſo that with good cauſe he is reputed as abſolute a Monark as any other in <hi>India.</hi> The Banny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſwarm like Locuſts here; the Bramyns are no where more reputed of: the Temples indeed in their ſtructures boaſt of no great bravery, but are proud within; reteyning many rich and maſſy Idolls, ſhaped and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Devil for his ſervice and their devotion.</p>
               <p>BISNAGAR (<hi>Modura</hi> of old, <hi>Arcati</hi> ſaies <hi>Caſtaldus</hi>) is the ſecond Citie in <hi>Narſinga</hi> for grandeur and braverie; being circled with a wall of foure miles compaſſe, and as well fortefied: well built, and no leſſe wealthy. Some Churches it has, remarkable for ſhape &amp; ornament; but in their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſme baſe and immodeſt, yea unworthy the relation. The Port or Haven is good to anchor in: the Citie well frequented by European ſhips and Iunks from <hi>Malacca, Pegu, Cambogia, Cochyu-Chyna, Chyna, Iapan, Phyllip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinae,</hi> the <hi>Moluccae, Borneo, Iava, Sumatra, Zeiloon,</hi> and many parts of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, Arabia, Perſia,</hi> and like places.</p>
               <p>When any Traveller comes to his Court, he ſhall have fitting entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and is many times invited by the King, the better to ſhew his fine cloaths, which to ſhew ourſelves thankfull we will report to other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; being thick ſet with ſtones and gems of infinite valew and wonderfull luſtre; which when he is roabed with (for the reſemblance they have with the Son, which they worſhip) he is adored: his Court is full of Majeſty, his guard being a thouſand penſioners: he affects poligamy, and therefore writes himſelfe husband of a thouſand women; many of them having him all his life in ſuch eſteeme, that at his Death they make his flaming Grave their conſuming Sepulcher.</p>
               <p>MESVLIPATAN, commonly pronounc't by contraction <hi>Meſtipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> is ſubject to the Gulcundan King, and removed from the Equinoctiall 16 degr. and a halfe, North; ſeated in the skirt of the <hi>Bengalan</hi> Ocean. The whole province admits a mixture of ſeverall Idolatries; in moſt parts the <hi>Saracius</hi> and <hi>Bannyans</hi> being the greateſt number. <hi>Mahomet</hi> was bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted among them by a Colony of Perſians conducted hither in the 28 yeare of the <hi>Aegyra</hi> and of our account 648 by <hi>Abdall Ben Hemyr</hi> a man of no ſmal reckoning with <hi>Ozman</hi> the then <hi>Calyph</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> &amp; <hi>Mecca,</hi> ſince when their off-ſpring have here inhabited.

The ſtreets are few, and narrow; the houſes low and unfurniſhed; the fields and gardens parcht by flaming <hi>Phaeton,</hi> which here rages from March to Iuly; from thence to Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the wind and raine as inceſſantly diſturbing them: ſo as of twelve months, they have but foure from November to March ſalubrious and moderate: howbeit by reaſon of the Engliſh reſidence here, of late traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficking for callicoes, rice, and the like, it begins to flouriſh, and is not to be doubted unleſſe the unquiet and deceitfull humour of the people diſtaſte the Engliſh and force their removall to adjacent places as <hi>Armagun</hi> and <hi>Polycat,</hi> where they may ſit downe with more eaſe, leſſe charge and choyſer merchandizes.</p>
               <p>Hence remove your chaſt eyes and eares to an unchaſt Towne, though <hi>Caſta</hi> by name; a Towne infamous in curſed demonomy and wantonneſſe. The Moſques have Idols in them, ſhewing art in ſculpture very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but hatefull in the ſtinck of their devotion. The common ſhapes of Pagods here reſemble beaſtly <hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Pan</hi> (as is deſcribed by <hi>Servius</hi> in <hi>Aegloc</hi> 2 <hi>Virgil</hi>) having great eyes, flat noſe, wide mouth, foure great hornes, a long beard ſhaped like beames or radiance of he Sun, clawes for hands, and crooked legd, all over deformed.</p>

Some Temples of Idolatry <hi>Patania</hi> ſhews, furniſht with wooden gods for politheiſme; but more note-worthy in ſome antick Monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of former Kings.</p>
               <p>The people are black, and go with the moſt part of their bodies naked: they take great delight in eating of Betle and Opium, and love Areck (or ſtrong liquor) exceedingly: they uſually eat in plates of gold.

               <p>IAVA the greater, is an Ile nigh the <hi>Bengalan</hi> Sea, declining ſeven (ſome obſerve nine) degr. 40 minutes towards the Antartick Pole from the Equinoctiall; and in the 120 degrees of longitude. From Eaſt to Weſt it ſtretches one hundred and fifty leagues, or of engliſh miles foure hundred and fifty; from North to South nintie leagues, or two hundred and ſeventie miles: the midland is for the moſt part mountainous and ill peopled; the marittim low, and populous: the firſt is windy, but conducing to health; the latter mariſh, and inſalubrious.</p>
               <p>It is full of ſmall villages, and inhabitants: the ſea coaſt (by reaſon of trade for pepper) has Townes well built, moſt wealthy, and beſt defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: upon the North ſide, and to the N.E. eſpecially, are <hi>Bantam, Palam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, Iackatra</hi> (new named <hi>Batavia</hi> by the Duch; but formerly <hi>Sunda-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapa</hi> by the Inhabitants,) <hi>Iaparra, Tuban, Iortan, Greecy, Chyringin, Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baya</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bantam</hi> is under Antartick declination or latitude, 6 degr. 20 minutes, and of weſterly variation 3 degrees: the biggeſt Citie in the Iland; ownd by the Natives, built well nigh two miles long, diſtinguiſht into a Buzzar; the <hi>Pengrans</hi> Pallace, a few ſtreets, and at the furtheſt end the Cheneſes live together in low built dwellings. Of it ſelfe it affords nothing ſave ryce, pepper, and cotten woll: though indeed, pepper for the greateſt part is brought hither by the crafty but infinitely induſtrious Chyney men, who each <hi>Ianuary</hi> anchor here, and unload their Iuncks or Prawes from <hi>Iamby, Borneo, Malacca,</hi> and diversother places; making <hi>Bantam</hi> their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen or Beehive, out of which they furniſh the Engliſh &amp; other merchants. Theſe Chyneſes are men of peace, voluptuous, venereous, coſtly in their ſports, great gameſters, and in trading over ſubtle for young Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian merchants: oft-times they are ſo wedded to dicing, that after they have loſt their whole eſtate, wife and Children are ſtak't and parted with; yet in little time by gleaning here and there, he will be able to redeeme them; if not, at the day, they are ſold in the market.</p>

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:20354:171"/>
a Date-ſtone, others like Egges of Doves, ſome like Cheznuts, and Goats kidnies; all agree in this, they are blunt ended: they are no leſſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and divers in colour; ſome being red, pale-greene ſome, other-ſome of a dark yellow, and ſome sky-coloured: the laſt are beſt, theſe conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many skales (like Unions and Onions) circumvolving one the other, and in which. Nature has expreſt farre more excellency, than Arts beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity or perfection: for, each inferior skale (not unlike the glorious Orbes inverted) yeelds freſher beauty, and more celeſtiall ſplendor than the former: each skale diminiſhing &amp; being of more vertue, as the Bezar is in tenuity or craſſitude. Many are counterfeit. They try them thus, either by pearcing them with hot bodkins; or after they have wayd them, to ſteep them in cold water foure houres; and if it crack not, tis not feyned: to know it good, they then, wipe it, and ballance it againe; obſerving, if it weigh never ſo little above the firſt weight, 'tis baſe and deſpicable. Note alſo, that <hi>Borneo</hi> Bezars are not halfe ſo valewable as <hi>Perſia's.</hi>

               <p>Lignum Aloes, from diverſity of Countries, varie in their Nomenclati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Javans and Malayans name it, Garroo: Indians and Portuguizes, D' Aquillha, the Chinae, and Cochinchinae, Calamba: fram'd of large round ſticks, of a cloody graine, commixt with aſhy veines; no leſſe pleaſant to the eye, than to the hand ponderous: the reliſh or taſte proves bitter, in its language telling you, It would be burned; for, hot coales of Fyre no ſooner touch it, but it incendiates, and (to the honour of its owne Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſolemnity) expires and breaths out an odor ſo aromatick and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that no other is uſed by the Indians, Malayans, Siamites, Peguans; Cambogians, and Borneans, when they incinerate the Carcaſſes of their moſt honoured Parents.</p>
               <p>Musk, is either yellow, browne, or black: the firſt is beſt, laſt is baſeſt: the choyſeſt yellow ſhews a deep Amber complection (not unlike Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard) cloathed with a reaſonable moiſt skin, ſweating out ſome briſtly hayres, without ſtones, lead, or like adulterate mixtures; of ſo ſtrong a ſmell as ſeemes offenſive; but taſted, penetrates a ſtrong braine by its fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor: ſweet ſpices dead it; and put in the mouth, if it ſuddenly diſſolve, or in the hand if it be long a melting; thoſe trialls diſcover it for bad and imperfect.</p>
               <p>Civit, is diverſified in colour alſo: deep yellow (I have beene told) is beſt, the worſt is white, geraſie and ſophiſticat: how beit, the new is pale, and ſoone after groweth yellowiſh.</p>
               <p>Benjamin, by the Malayans call'd Menyan; by other Indians Benyan: is either pure cleare white, or yellow, ſtreaked or coloured; the gum iſſues from a tree high, ſmall, and furniſhed with fruitleſſe branches; the leaves are not unlike the Olive: <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Siam</hi> yeelds the beſt; <hi>Arabia</hi> very good; that from <hi>Sumatra, Priaman</hi> and <hi>Barrouſe,</hi> courſe, and had: better lik'd of at <hi>Iava,</hi> than in <hi>England.</hi>

The moſt Southerly part is removed from the line 32 deg. the beſt Townes and Ports of ſtrength and trade are <hi>Meacco, Ozacca, Tenze, Fyrando, Fuccate</hi> (or <hi>Falcate</hi>) <hi>Sacay, Cratez, Tenkeday, Oringaw, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuquis, Machma, &amp;c.</hi> Of theſe, <hi>Meacco</hi> (a mediterran City) is call'd the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troplis, <hi>Surunga</hi> next, and next it <hi>Ozacca,</hi> honoured with the Court ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times till of late <hi>viz.</hi> 1615. a rebellious fire ſubverted and incinerated not it only, but many other Townes in that wealthy Province. <hi>Meacco</hi> is as big as <hi>Florence,</hi> but not ſo beautifull: proud in a ſweet and ſpatious river, in many low, but comly houſes; and memorable in abundance of ſtately Temples or Fotiquees full of guilded Mannad'as or Idolls; to which (above all other Nations) the Japonians are moſt addicted; the Jeſuits
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:20354:172"/>
induſtries &amp; ſeminaries there producing ſmall growth; inſtead of a happy harveſt reaping ſcorne and catholique apoſtaſre: Neither their grave aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, nor ſubtte ſophiſtry; neither their many miracles there, nor their collegiat bravery, having that force to make them thought other than fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, vain-glorious, and avaricious: ſuch is the reward of Hipocriſie; in ſhew ſeeming deſirous to do others good, in truth ayming at their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, gaine, and hope of Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>The government is Monarchicall: above threeſcore petty Kings do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and proſtrate their maſſy Coronets to be encircled, and to illuſtrate the Emperiall Diadem; from whoſe frowne, a puniſhment and affliction worſe than common death uſually is darted: ſuch is his power, his awe; ſuch their vaſſalage, their opinion of their Governors. The Country is moſt part mountanous; but full of floods, trees, corne, graſſe, and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls: every way preſents Villages, ſwarming with heithen Inhabitants: the North and Eaſt parts of <hi>Iapan</hi> are leſſe peopled than the South and Weſt; and thoſe much more ſavage and barbarous; cruell, trecherous, idle, laſcivious, and awed by no Law, nor any way induſtrious. The old Roman way of execution is here uſually ſuffered; they faſten malefactors to Croſſes with foure nailes; whether in hate to the Jeſuits, or of Antique cuſtome I am not certaine; but ſure it is, the puniſhment is full of torture and ignominious: the Civill Japonians are vallant, curteous, complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and great affectors of novelties; but beyond meaſure jealous, crafty, and revengefull, if injured; yea diveliſh, if exaſperated. They would, but cannot deny themſelves diſcended out of <hi>China,</hi> baniſht upon a heedleſſe rebellion ſix hundred yeeres ago; in memory of which, they hate one another mortally, no quarter being given to either Nation at any time, nor ceaſe the Ilanders to rob and piratize the Chyneſes at all advantages; at home alſo in their prayers abhominating them, and in all complements and ceremonies varying from one another to expatiate their wrath and unnaturall diſtempers. In any ſlight ſuſpect or accuſation, the very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſo jealous of their reputations, that in caſe you loſe a trifle and ſay to one of them; ſyrrah I beleeve you have ſtolen it? without any pauſe the boy will immediatly cut off a joynt from one finger or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſay Sir, if you ſay true, I wiſh my finger may never heale againe: murder, theft, treaſon, and adultery, are puniſht with death; either cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, or beheadded with a Cuttan; an Indian ſword which ſlices eaſily.</p>
               <p>Towns of note and ſtrength are <hi>Ozacca</hi> (80 leagues from <hi>Bungo</hi>) a Port Towne of good note, and neare the Sea; ſtrong and beautifull: in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more famous nor obſervable than in the royall Caſtle, varniſhed, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and burniſht over with flaming gold; rich and majeſticall: form'd of the beſt ſhape, of excellent ſtone; the walls, every where twenty foot thick, finely fram'd, well poliſht, curiouſly cemented, pleaſant, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: circled with deep trenches full of water; and for entrance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſhewes above a dozen iron Gatest, and drawing Bridges.</p>
               <p>It has formerly ſuccoured many Kings, and ſecur'd them from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit and heat of Rebels; in this as memorable, 'twas of late yeeres made the priſon of <hi>Goja-zamma</hi> Prince of <hi>Tanzey</hi> and eldeſt Sonne of <hi>Tiquazamma</hi> the late victorious Emperour; whoſe Father <hi>Faxiba-zamma</hi> ſubjected all
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:20354:172"/>
the petty Princes of <hi>Iapan;</hi> and made them by oath and pledge agniſe him and his their Soveraignes: <hi>Coja-zamma</hi> upon his Fathers ſudden death was as ſuddenly ſeiz'd upon by <hi>Ogoſho-zamma</hi> one of the three Protectors, and by him compelled to betroath his daughter; and for portion was if thruſt, and for ever damned to this hatefull Priſon. Againſt <hi>Ozacca,</hi> on the other ſide the river is ſeated <hi>Sucay</hi> a Towne well traded to by Chriſtians: <hi>Edoo</hi> is well wall'd and peopled: 15 leagues thence is <hi>Oringoo</hi> a Towne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording good refreſhment and excellent harbouring or anchorage. <hi>Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando</hi> (300 leagues thence, to coaſt thither,) is a Cherſoneſſe and elevates the Artick Pole 33 degrees, 30 minutes: var. Eaſt 2 degrees 50 minutes: where and at <hi>Fuccate</hi> the Engliſh had a reſidence or factory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fucate</hi> or <hi>Fulcate</hi> is pretty ſweet Towne, well watered, and ownes a ſtrong and defenſive Caſtle or Fortreſſe: a Forreſt of loftie Pines and ſpreading Sycomores for three miles ſpace environs it; with other Groves of force againſt the ſcorching Sun; delightfull to the eye, yea more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than any other object: but (which renders them ingrate and baſely idolatrous) under thoſe greene trees, and in many ſmall but richly tyl'd Temples or Fotiques, they adore <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Priapus,</hi> yea Satan himſelfe in his uglieſt reſemblances: for where the Country is moſt inhabited and garniſht with moſt variety of trees, graſſe, corne, &amp;c. (as, 'twixt <hi>Edoo</hi> and <hi>Suringa</hi>) there are erected moſt Fotiques, there the people are moſt idolatrous.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Meacco</hi> are 70 Temples, wherein they number 3333 Chamaetirae or little guilded Devils, to which they give divine reſpect: they call them <hi>Mannadaes:</hi> But more notable than the reſt is that in <hi>Meacco;</hi> not unlike the Rhodyan Coloſſus, huge &amp; wonderfull. This was built by <hi>Tyco-zamma,</hi> and without much paine and coſt was not finiſhed: 'tis of Oricalke or guilded Copper; its poſture is fitting in a Chaire 70 foot high, and 80 broad: his head is capable to ſupport fifteene men, who may ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without preaſing: his thumb is forty inches about; and his other limbs proportionable. This is the grand <hi>Pagotha:</hi> the other are <hi>Dii mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores,</hi> or of leſſe adoration. No leſſe notable is the Monument adjoyning, in a Cloiſter within the principall Fotique of <hi>Meacco,</hi> where are gallantly interred (but to their ignominie) the eares &amp; noſes of 3000 Coreans, a baſe, theeviſh people, vicinating &amp; infeſting the Japonians. At <hi>Dabys</hi> is another Mannada no leſſe infamous and reſorted to: this Devill (or Molech) is of concave copper, vaſt, thick, and double guilded: its height is foure and twenty foot, and would be more but that they have form'd it kneeling, his buttocks reſting upon his leggs after the uſuall mode of the Eaſterne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: his armes are safe ſtretcht to the utmoſt; and at ſolemne times is inflam'd within, and ſacrific'd unto by offering him a child, which in's embraces is fride to death in an infernall torture. But of more note is another at <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedy</hi> Eaſt thence, where Sathan viſibly playes th'Impoſtor. The Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique is of rare ſtructure, and daily ſerved by a multitude of helliſh Prieſts or Bonzees; not admitted to attend there, except they be young, well ſhap't, and as ſtrong in venerie as was <hi>Hercules,</hi> Every new Moon they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly betroth unto the Devill a Damoſell, whoſe Parents account the ceremonie happie and honourable: if any be more faire or ſingular than

another, ſhee is ſelected, by the luſtfull Prieſts devoted, and brought into the Temple, and placed right againſt the Mamada or Idoll: the roome is firſt made glorious with Lamps of burniſht gold, and a preparation by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiating <hi>Lignum vitae,</hi> or other gums and perfumes, ſuch as be curious and coſtly: by and by the Lamps extinguiſh by myracle, and in a groſſe darkneſſe the Prince of darkneſſe approaches and abuſes her; ſo ſhee imagines, and the rather credited, in that the Devill leaves behind him certaine ſcales like thoſe of fiſhes, an argument of no phantaſma: but, by this helliſh conjunction they ſwell not, unleſſe the Bonzee ſecond it: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is no ſooner gone, but ſhe is ſaluted by the Bonzees, who raviſh her with ſongs and pleaſant muſique; which ended, ſhee acquaints them with her fortune, and reſolves them in ſuch queſtions, as ſhe by their inſtruction propounded to the Devill, and he had ſatisfied her in: ſhee iſſues with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and ever after is reputed holy and honourable: many other things I could preſent you from tradition, but I avoyd (as much as may be) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert incertainties: from hence therefore faile wee Weſt and land in <hi>Chyna,</hi> where though the travaile be difficult, yet ſuffer me to glean a little, though it but expreſſe my induſtrie and care to offer you the trueſt Novelties.</p>

The whole Empire is divided into fifteene great Provinces: governed by ſo many Quon-fu and Lauſia; who have their Tutans, and Chyans, or Deputies under them. Each of thoſe Provinces has a Metropolis: full of people; fairely built; and very ſpatious. But every way more excellent than the reſt, are theſe foure, <hi>Paquin</hi> by ſome called <hi>Paſquin: Nanquin</hi> or <hi>Nanton: Cantam</hi> or <hi>Canton:</hi> and <hi>Quinſay,</hi> by them called <hi>Ham-ceu:</hi> of which foure, at this day <hi>Paquin</hi> is chiefe or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall.</p>
               <p>PAQVIN elevates the North Pole 41 degr. 15 minutes; and by late Geographers is accounted that ſame Citie which ſome call <hi>Cambalu</hi> water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Poliſanga;</hi> and <hi>China</hi> then muſt bee <hi>Cathaya:</hi> yea (if <hi>Pantoja,</hi> and <hi>Di Canti</hi> ſay true) the <hi>Chyna</hi> Monarch is that ſame great <hi>Cam,</hi> which <hi>M. P. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netus</hi> and <hi>Mandevile</hi> afore him have famouſed. The Citie <hi>Pequin</hi> is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe the moſt ſpatious, and beſt peopled in <hi>Aſia,</hi> if not in the world: ſince it has 30 Duch leagues (ninety Engliſh miles) circumference: it includes many ſtately buildings; and Mauſoleas; 24000 are numbered of the Mandarins Sepulchers; the meaneſt of which, is not without beauty: and a no leſſe number of little guilded Chappells, beſide 3800 Temples devoted to Idolatry. It has as many Gates &amp; Poſterns as be dayes in a yeer: ſixſcore Buzzars or Market-places: above a thouſand Bridges of ſtone: and ſuch water as is every where potable. This City is not above a hundred miles from that marvellous wall, which <hi>Criſnagol</hi> their King (<hi>Zaintzon</hi> the 117 King ſome ſay) built 1000 yeeres ago, to keep out the invading Tartarr: a wall 1200 miles long; ſix fathoms high; twelve yards thick; and ſuch as was ſeven and twenty yeeres erecting, by a continued labour of 750000 men.</p>
               <p>NANQVIN (the ſecond Citie for grandeur and bravery, till of late,) was the <hi>China</hi> Metropolis. It elevates the Artick Pole 32 degr. and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Sea 8 leagues or there abouts. The City is 12 leagues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; circled with three ſtrong walls and ditches: the Kings Pallace is glorious and vaſt; the other buildings many (for 200000 are reckned) but meanly beautifull: the Temples are above a thouſand: the ſtreets fayre; the people induſtrious: from <hi>Paquin</hi> removed Eaſt, ſix hundred miles Engliſh: moſt part of the way is navigable.</p>
               <p>CANTAM is at the South end of <hi>China,</hi> in 17 deg. a Towne both rich and ſpatious: our Ships came almoſt in view of it: from it to <hi>Paquin</hi> is two months travell.</p>
               <p>QVINZAY or <hi>Ham-ceu</hi> borders <hi>Cochin-China:</hi> of old, the greateſt, at this day the moſt admirable for variety of antick rarities in the Orient.</p>
               <p>Theſe bee the moſt noted, but many other great and populous Cities this great Empire conteineth: generally of one ſhape and alike governed: None be without their Meani or Temples fild with Deaſtri or Idols. The Countrey is generally champaign and fruitfull; the husbandmans care and paines make it to fructifie and repay its thanks in various tribute: each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince there is well watered: and few of thoſe rivers but abound in fiſh, which the Chyneſes not only banquet on, but on Frogs, Snakes, Rats, Dogs, Hogs, and ſuch food as many other Nations abhominate: they fiſh with Cormorants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:20354:174"/>The people are Olive coloured; more black or white as they vary from the Aequinoctiall: they weare their haire very long, and fillited; their eyes are commonly black; their noſes little; their eyes ſmall; their beards deformedly thin; and nailes often times as long as their fingers, ſerving as a mark to diſtinguiſh the Gentry by. The better ſort are habited in ſilke and a ſleight ſort of ſatten; the meaner, in black cloth made of cotton: their coats or veſts are long and quilted; made to tye under the left arme after the uſuall garb of <hi>Aſia;</hi> their ſleeves are alſo very long, and at the wriſt very ſtrait: their ſhoes are many times of ſuch ſtuffe as bee their coats; and ſoaled with cloth or callicoes: ſome have them richly imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The greateſt variety amongſt them is in their head attire: ſome knit their hayre in cawles of ſilk, of horſe-hayre ſome, and ſome with fillets of gold or ſilver: others weare high caps or felts made of fine twigs, round, and commixt with ſilk of divers colours; and other-ſome an antick ſort of hat, high crown'd, round, one halfe without brim, and tawny coloured. The women are commonly modeſt, and differ not in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell; in that a like vaile of white linnen wholly couers them; ſhewing nothing but their polt-feet, which from their infancy are ſtraitned; ſo as to make them alla mode, many of them are maymed.</p>
               <p>They tollerate Polligamy, and Sodomy; yea, what elſe their luſtfull idle natures can dictate to pleaſe their effeminacies. They are generally crafty, proud, laſie, jealous, complementall, and voluptuous. Muſick, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, Painting, and Stage-plaies delight them exceedingly: they care not what they ſpend in luxury and fire-works: they eat in porcellane; and have their dyet in many but ſmall diſhes; their meat minc't, and which they take up with two ſticks of bone or Jvory; but ſome have their nailes ſo long as may excuſe them; for to touch their mouths or meat with fingers is held abſurd and impious: their drinck is commonly hot, and by its taſt and colour ſeemes to be ſuch a Coho potion as they drinck in <hi>Perſia;</hi> they drinck oft and little. The Louthya's are ſerved on the knee, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; they all ſit upon ſtooles and eat on Tables. And albeit no Nation in the world is more idle and gluttenous; yet are no beggars to be found there; if he be young and beg, the whip rewards him; if old or lame, or blind, the Hoſpitall releeves him. Murder they puniſh with death; theft and adultery commonly with the ſtrappado: their Juſtice is ſevere and impartiall; their priſons, ſtrong; their executions, beheading; or ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them. The Mandarins are honoured; the Chyam's reverenced; the King adored: no Subject nor Ambaſſador ever ſees or ſpeaks with him, (ſave his children and Eunuchs) except by petition. They ſuffer Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors (or others) to enter <hi>China</hi> ſo they bring preſents of valew; otherwiſe they ſuſpect them as ſpies and no way honour them. The Chynaes are curious in novelties: and love to ſee ſtrange Arts; which they alſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully practiſe: few of them but has skill in ſome thing; either in tillage, making <hi>China</hi> diſhes or porcellane, to paint, ſing, or play well: the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks they affect, &amp; the civill Laws: they uſe not letters but Characters, or Hyerogliphicks, of which they have above 40000: they write neither to the right hand nor to the left, as the Latin and Hebrews did; but right downe and ſimmetrically: they write with pencills made of horſe hayre,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:20354:174"/>
ſuch as they alſo paint with: their language is moſt part of monoſyllables: they be generally Poets and Muſicians: affected with Rhetorick and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination. The Schollers and Merchants in this republique are much more honoured than the Souldiers bee: and ſome reaſon they have for it, They are ſo cowardly, laſie, and tyrannicall. No people in the world more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their King than do the Chynaes: they ſuppoſe him too glorious for them to look upon; they obey his will in every thing; they fill his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequor yeerely with above a hundred millions of crownes; they call him The undaunted Emperour, and great Lord of the whole World; Son of the Sun; and beauty of the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>No people whatſoever, expreſſe more filiall reſpect unto their Parents than the Chyneſes do: they obey them at all times, and every where: they do nothing to diſpleaſe them: they marry not without their aſſent: their childrens Names are at their diſpoſing: they honour them, bee they never ſo meane; releeve them, bee they never ſo poore; at their death, expreſſe all ſymptoms poſſible of their loyalty and duty: and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome mourne leſſe (in white linnen, as did the Jewes) than two or three yeeres; the longer they mourne, they think they the better expreſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>They arrogate all ſorts of excellencies whether in Art or Science, as peculiar to their Nation: they think their Speech the moſt ſweet and rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall of any in the world: what other people have, they judge deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and borrowed from their tranſcendent Notions. They ſay they are the moſt ancient and immixt people in the Univerſe; and borrow nothing of any other Nation. They ſay they firſt invented Letters (or Characters,) Guns, Painting, Tillage, and Navigation: yet in none of theſe (for all their brags) can they parallell us of <hi>Europe.</hi> For their antiquity, I deny not but they may have continued their plantation and without much mixture (admirable if ſo, for the Tartarrs and Siamits have oft over-runne them) ſince the firſt ſeminary, begunne by <hi>Sem</hi> in thoſe parts: yet may others in that point compare with them; I might nominate the Bryttains: for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not their Lies and Hiſtories of ſuch Kings as reigned, or ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts as the Chyneſes obteined (long before the birth of Time) a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand yeeres ago; unleſſe wee qualifie it by the example of the Arcadians, whoſe yeare had but ninety dayes; of the Maſſagers, who had fifteen yeeres, or of the Aegyptians who had twelve yeeres in one of ours; following the courſe of the Moone, and not the revolution of the Sunne, nor regarding the <hi>Dies intercalares:</hi> an error, moſt of the Orientall Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niques are plunged in. Their letters are not ſo ſuccinct as ours: their Hieroglyphicks come ſhort of the Aegyptians. Their Guns are not ſo ſerviceable: they have them not above a ſpan long; ſo that they rather reſemble Piſtols than Guns: nor are their bore nor ſquaring ſo good as ours; ſo ſtrong, ſo near, ſo mathematicall. Their painting is of good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; but their deſigning farre ſhort of our invention: they draw the poſtures filthily, and ſhadow meanly; which doubtleſſe in painting makes the perfection. Their husbandry is without Art or Reaſon: the graine is good, the ſoyle rich, the Zone moderate; and yet their corne is neither ſo various, ſo good, nor ſo certaine, as be our Harveſts. Their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:20354:175"/>
is lame: they build many ſhips; but without beauty, or ſervice: nor have they much skill in ſayling, their Logarithms and Mathematick inſtruments to take the height of the Sun by failing them: their Compaſſe alſo is defective; for they have but eight or twelve points at moſt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh by: nor is the Magnet (till of late) acquainted with them: for all which, they ſay they ſee with two eyes; we with one; and that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people be more than purblind in ſottiſh ignorance.</p>
               <p>They delight exceſſively in all ſorts of games, and voluptuouſneſſe: they can play at cheſſe, iriſh, paſſage, in and in, hazard; and not only play great games, but when they have loſt, care not though they ſtake their wives and children; whom if they loſe, they part with till they can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſo much money as they were ſtaked for. They are very hoſpitable one to another, and have ſo ſure a faith of the Reſurrection that they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lend money to be repayed them in the world to come. Inter-Iudes, Maſqs, Fire-workes, and ſuch devices wonderfully take them: nor valew they what money they expend in ſuch ſport, ſo their expectation bee not deluded. Their houſes are meanly built, and as badly furniſhed. Their Meani or Temples have no ſuch grandeur, nor beauty, as in a Countrey ſo peacefull, ſo rich, and amongſt a people ſo ſtudious, ſo ſuperſtitious, might be chalenged: but though their outſides bee but ordinary, yet bee they many times lined with excellent good Marble, Prophyre and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine.</p>
               <p>They celebrate their Natalitia or Birth-daies with great ſolemnity: for fifteene dayes they rejoyce and play; and each night gormundiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on choice fruits, wines, and cates, with no ſmall voracity. The New yeere, which they begin in March, is no leſſe illuſtrated: at that time every man reares up his Pageant, and beautifies his door with paper Arches, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and all the night long makes them viſible by ſtore of Lantherns.</p>
               <p>Their Weddings have equal Ceremony: greater or leſſer after the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Deceaſed. When any Chyna dies, they waſh him every where, perfume him next, and then apparrell him: they put his beſt cloaths on, and hate to let his head be naked: that done, they ſeat him in his chayre, and make him ſit as if hee were not dead but living. At a ſet time his wife enters the roome; ſhe firſt does him reſpect, kiſſes him, and takes her farewell by expreſſing ſo much love and ſorrow as is poſſible: at her departure ſhe takes her lodging, and her children next enter; where they kneele and kiſſe his hands, yea ſympathiſe, and ſtrive to out-vie each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their ejaculations, and ſuch outward notions of ſorrow and piety as is imaginable; beating their breaſts, and powring out teares in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: next to them his kindred do their parts, and then his friends and other acquaintance: the third day they coffin him, in moſt pretious wood; cover it with a coſtly cloth, and over it place his Image: for fifteen dayes the corps reſt ſo; each day having a Table ſpread with dainty meats, but nightly the Prieſts eat it and burne Incenſe, &amp; offer an expiatory Sacrifice: when they carry it to the grave (which is neither within any Town nor Citie) they have women that do accompany it, purpoſely hyred to howle, to teare their hayre, and to move others to compaſſion: ſometimes upon his coffin they place divers pictures of dead men, whom they intreat to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:20354:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhew him the beſt way to Paradiſe: that done, his wife and children for ſome dayes ſeclude themſelves from ſight of men: and when they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, go dolorouſly habited: they put courſe ſack-cloth next their skin; have their cloaths made long and plain; and for three yeeres ſcarce laugh, or ſeeme to joy in any thing: but contrariwiſe indeavour to the utmoſt of their power to agrandiſe their Duty by a continued lamentation, abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from publique feaſts, and paſtimes: yea in all their letters, inſtead of their Names ſubſcribe themſelves Such a ones diſobedient and unworthy Child, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But for all this, the Devill has too great a ſoveraignty over them: moſt of their Colledges and Temples expreſſing by one or other invention, their infernall wiſdome, and familiarity with that old Magician; to whom they devote many enthuſiaſtick boyes, who with their long ſpread haire, proſtrate themſelves afore the Mannada or Idoll; and ſuddenly as if ſome Hag had terrified them, ſtart up and vibrate their ſwords, kept there of purpoſe: whiles the Idolaters with dejected lookes note their antick po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and ceaſe not to warble out a ſoft Doriq' ſort of muſick, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting till the vaticinating youths pronounce ſomewhat, poynting at his Worſhip and their Obedience.</p>
               <p>But we have ſaild too far. Tis high time to look homewards. Yet not till we have bid farewell to <hi>Aſia:</hi> into which when others adventure, let this Motto be remembred.</p>

To our view, it gave it ſelfe not very high at 6 leag. diſtance: and this remember, that at the South-Weſt-end are Syrtes or ſhoalds long and very dangerous.

                  <hi>Mauritius</hi> is an Ile abounding with all good things requiſite for mans uſe, and require-able for the Zone 'tis placed in: the land (eſpecially where it reſpects the Sea) is high and mountainous: the ſhape ſomewhat round; the circuit not much above a hundred Engliſh miles: the greateſt extent is from the North Eaſt to South-Weſt: every where ſweet &amp; flouriſhing. It procreates a healthie ayre; the blooming fragrant trees both lenifie the ſcalding heat ſuch time as <hi>Don-Phoebus</hi> wantonizes with the Goat; and fan the gentle Breezes waſted from the <hi>Noto-Zephirus,</hi> ſuch time as <hi>Sol</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in <hi>Cancer.</hi> And here I ſhould ſet a full point to her commendations, did that ignorant opinion of our home-bred Seniors diſcourage me, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming poſitively that the Torrid Zone was un-inhabitable: a conceit ſometime predominating; but now that miſt of error is diſpell'd, the vaile removed, and experience advanced: wee ſee it yearely, and plainly, that no place 'twixt the two Poles is more habitable, more young, more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.

And as that body is beſt compounded which pertakes indifferently of all the Elements; for either to want or ſuperabound, begets defect: ſo, to be bleſt in all, this place (humane ſocietie excepted) is abortive in none. For, water is here in plenty; nor is its goodneſſe and ſweetneſſe excell'd by plentie; but, as it gently drills it ſelfe from the ſtupendious rocks; ſo it trickles along the pleaſant valleyes, as it were beſotted at the delightfull murmur it liveth in: in ſome places it ſpreads into Meanders, till (too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in its owne mildneſſe) it commixes, and is ingulpht by that vaſt and brinie Ocean.

I could hardly beget paſſages. The Palmeto is a remarkable Tree and moſt beneficiall to Travellers: 'tis like the Coco or Date in growth, ſave that her boughes are large and rounder: the Palmeto is long, and ſtraight, and round, and ſoft; without leafe, bough, or branch, ſave at the very top; and thoſe are few, and greene, and ſedgie: under the branch appeare certaine codded ſeeds: both trees (male and female) bloſſome, but the ſhee is only fruitfull; and not ſo neither, unleſſe a flowring branch of the male tree be yearely innoculated or incorporated, that by a commixture of ſeed the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male may fructifie; no miracle in Nature: the leaves ſerve for many uſes; wee made them cover our Tents, to ſhade us from the Sun and the ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which fall nightly, and are dangerous: at the top of the Palmeto tree is a ſoft pith, in which conſiſts the ſoule or vergetative vertue, for being cut out the tree dyes; the pith is in bigneſſe like a ſmall Cabbage, in taſte like a Nut, but boyld eats like a Colli-flory. Of more value is the Palmeto wine; it is muſt or ſweet, pleaſant and nouriſhing; in colour and taſte not unlike new Muskadine. It is intoxicating, but cold in the digeſtion; it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and helps obſtructions, kills wormes, and let ſtand two dayes in the Sun, becomes good vinegar. The wine is thus gathered: we peirce or cut ſmall holes in three or foure trees that grow together; the ſap or liquor effudes preſently, and all the holes or veſſells are quickly filled: impatience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids to bring wooden barrycoes thither, our bellies were prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; by help of a Cane or Quill we ſuck and ſuck againe, from one tree to another, two or three trees in leſſe than an houre repletiating the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt appetites, though they bowze their bellies full.</p>

Nor for another very frequent there, but by its likeneſſe the ſame which the barbarous Africans at <hi>Sierra-leon</hi> call <hi>O'gou,</hi> with which they invenome their Darts and Shafts: the Tree is not high nor bungie; the branches ſpread to a great length, and beare many Cods (not unlike the Indian Beanes) arm'd with many ſharp prickles: by ſuch a defence one would think the fruit or kernell valuable, but it decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us; the fruit (or kernell hid within thoſe Cods) is round, ſcarce ſo big as a Doves egge; the ſhell, and colour very like a Bezar ſtone; hard to crack, but crackt it may be; within, it has a Nut, taſted like an Acorne, the quality (if not the ſame) little better than poyſon. Many other rare
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:20354:178"/>
Trees there are; ſome, like unto Pines; like Aſhes, ſome; ſome, Box; ſome like to Cypreſſes. The fruits are alſo variable, ſome like Pine-Apples, like Artichoakes ſome, others like Plums, and Nuts, and Berries: whoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall names or vertues, my ſmall skill in that Theory apprehends not. This I tooke notice of, that what the Birds eat not, the Tortoyſes doe eat; and what the Tortoyſes refuſe to eat, the Hoggs devoure: ſo, as by one or other, all is taſted of. Againe, as this noble Ile is prodigall in her water and wood, ſo ſhee correſponds in what elſe a fruitfull Parent labours in: not only boaſting in that variety, but in feathered creatures alſo; yea, in the rareneſſe of that variety: I will but name ſome of them; you ſhall lick them to perfection. The Dodo comes firſt to our deſcription: here, and in <hi>Dygarrois</hi> (and no where elſe, that ever I could ſee or heare of) is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Dodo (a Portuguize name it is, and has reference to her ſimple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,) a Bird which for ſhape and rareneſſe might be call'd a Phoenix (wer't in <hi>Arabia:</hi>) her body is round and extreame fat, her ſlow pace begets that corpulencie; few of them weigh leſſe than fifty pound: better to the eye than ſtomack: greaſie appetites may perhaps commend them, but to the indifferently curious, nouriſhment, but prove offenſive. Let's take her picture: her viſage darts forth melancholy, as ſenſible of Natures injurie in framing ſo great and maſſie a body to be directed by ſuch ſmall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall wings, as are unable to hoiſe her from the ground, ſerving only to prove her a Bird; which otherwiſe might be doubted of: her head is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly dreſt, the one halfe hooded with downy blackiſh feathers; the other, perfectly naked; of a whitiſh hue, as if a tranſparent Lawne had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it: her bill is very howked and bends downwards, the thrill or breathing place is in the midſt of it; from which part to the end, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is a light greene mixt with a pale yellow; her eyes be round and ſmall, and bright as Diamonds; her cloathing is of fineſt Downe, ſuch as you ſee in Goſlins: her trayne is (like a <hi>China</hi> beard) of three or foure ſhort feathers; her legs thick, and black, and ſtrong; her tallons or pounces ſharp, her ſtomack fiery hot, ſo as ſtones and iron are eaſily digeſted in it; in that and ſhape, not a little reſembling the <hi>Africk</hi> Oeſtriches: but ſo much, as for their more certain difference I dare to give thee (with two others) her repreſentation.</p>

               <p>Here are alſo as great variety of fiſh, as in any other part of the world, I thinck: ſuch as wee took and taſted of I noted. The Man-atee or Cow-fiſh was beſt and rareſt; for taſte and ſhape equally can appoſe both feeder and beholder. They uſe both elements; thoſe very fins which ſteare them in the Sea, ſerve as ſtilts on ſhore to creep along, and to ſupport them; their paps alſo in their land travels do befriend them: and though a fiſh, yet differ little from Veale in taſt, ſave that it is ſomewhat wateriſh; the ribs and entralls reſemble a Cows, ſo do their face, and thence have their denomination: for doubtleſſe the land has not that creature which the watery citizens reſemble not. This fiſh is of a great length, and ſwims but ſlowly; they affect ſhoald waters, and to be neare the ſhoare to graze on; <hi>Andrew Evans</hi> our honeſt Captaine, ſtruck one of them with a Trident or Fiſ-gigg, and (here in this Bay) leapt upon her, wounding her above fifty times with his ſteletto, but ere hee got the victory, ſhe cruſht him by incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling him with her taile, enraged by ſharp pangs of death, ſo that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was dearly bought; for though at that preſent he ſpat blood without feeling other torture, yet ſo mortall was his bruiſe, that he bade this world farewell, within three weekes after; as in my deſcription of <hi>Saint Helena</hi> is remembred. The head of this fiſh is like an Elephant (ſave that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſcis is wanting:) but to a Cow moſt liken her: her eyes are very ſmall; her bulk, about three yards long; and in bredth halfe ſo much: 'tis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſed for a gentle fiſh; yea in their love to the viſage of a man, are ranckt with Dolphins: moſt certaine and moſt valewable is the ſtone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated in their heads: for, being pounded, put in wine, &amp; drunck faſting, it is (as are the brains of Sharks, ſome call them Tuberons) moſt ſoveraigne againſt the ſtone and collick: queſtionleſſe of more priſe than his other ſix great teeth, which yet to him are farre more uſefull.</p>
               <p>Give mee leave to name what fiſh wee took, 'twill eaſe my memory: Dolphins, Bonetates, Albicores, Cavalloes, Whale, Porpice, Grampaſſe, (or <hi>Suſ-marinus,</hi>) Mullet, Bream, Tench, Trout, Soles, Flounders, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyſes, Eeles, Pikes, Sharkes, Crabs, Lobſters, Oyſters, Crafiſh, Cuttle-fiſh, Rock-fiſh, Limpits, and a ſpeckled Toad-fiſh or poyſon fiſh, as the Sea-men from experience named it: This came firſt to net and was eaten

too greedily by the heedles Sailers; an error which coſt ſome their lives, others their ſences; a deere rate, a bad reckning: It is not unlike a Tench, but farre more black, meazled, and deformedly painted. Other ſtrange made Fiſhes we had there, who met with ſome ſtrange ſtomacks, who in a dangerous curioſity would needs taſt them: ſome of them had the ſhape of Hedg-hogs, of Cats ſome: ſome were bungy, others briſtly and trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler; ſuch as <hi>Gorraeus</hi> calls <hi>Lepus marinus,</hi> of which and the reſt this caveat may be inſerted.</p>

               <p>Moreover, this Ile affoords us Goats, Hogs, Beeves, and land Tortoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: ſo great, as ſuffer two men with eaſe to ſit upon them; ſo ſtrong, as they can carry them: yea (in Portugall reports,) fifteene men have alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtood on one of them: Sailers affect to eat them; but are better meat for Hogs, in my opinion: they make pretty ſport, but are odious food; and ſo are their Rats, Bats, and Monkeys: moſt of which uſefull and unuſefull creatures were firſt brought hither (men ſay) by the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall to refreſh them in their returne from <hi>India,</hi> but at this day dare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anchor there (ſearing the Eagliſh and Dutch,) nor owne their firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. The Birds, had here at no charge and little labour, are Hens, Bats, Herns, &amp;c. The Hens flock together twenty and forty in a company; if you catch one, take all: the ſureſt way is to ſhew them a red cloth; that colour exaſperates their ſpleen, they ſhew it by flying out-ragiouſly at it; and when wee ſtruck downe one, the reſidue budgd not one jot till all were vanquiſhed: they eat like parcht Piggs if you roaſt them. The Herons alſo through a long continued ſecurity (ignorant of the deceits of men, and unuſed to the villany of powder) are as eaſily gotten: wee have come in ſhot of ſix, and when wee had killd one, the other took not wing but ſuffered us to ſhoot and take them all, one after another; neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor valuing danger, but quicken deſtruction to themſelves by a ſtrange condoling their late dead aſſociates. All ſorts of fiſh are eaſily taken.

               <p>The Ile has many good places to anchor in: two are well knowne; the one, at the North-Weſt ſide, which beares the forme of a Hemi-cicle, and elevates the Pole Antartique, 19 degrees, and 30 minutes: the other, at the South-Eaſt is directly oppoſite, and in 20 degrees, 15 minutes; in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude from Cape <hi>Comryn</hi> the utmoſt promontory of <hi>India,</hi> 20 degrees, 20 minutes: and from the Lizard the extreameſt part of England, 99. both Bayes ſeeme land-lockt, the ground is oazy, the depth in 5, 10, 15, or 20 fadoms, as the Sea-man beſt affects: No where dangerous.

fluxes: but, though the eare be angry at it, the other ſences derive much happineſſe; for hereby the earth is mellowed and made fruitfull, which otherwiſe would bee too full of ſtones and ſand; yet ſuch is the richneſſe of it, as rather commands us wonder at, than deſcribe it. Amber-greaſe is often found flooting about this Iland: how generated, whether in the Whale, or froth of Seas, or other wiſe, is yet doubted of. Corall, white and pleaſant to look upon, grows here in abunda-ce: but how that ſtincking weed Tobacco came thither I know not: whether by Art or Nature que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable.

               <p>The fift day we deſcried land; it bore South-Weſt from us: by its height, ſhape, and poſition, wee knew 'twas that our Captaines called Englands Forreſt: next day we attained it. The name was <hi>Anno</hi> 1613. impoſed by Captaine <hi>Caſtleton</hi> Commander of the Pearle (a ſhip I meane:) ſome ſay the errant Potugall firſt ſaw it, and by Seignior <hi>Maſcarenas</hi> from his owne name was denominated: yet other-ſome go further and call it <hi>Pulo-puar,</hi> an Indian name, but by whom or when, darkly writ in the miſtique Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Oblivion. The Ile has above fifty Engliſh miles circuit: the South Pole is elevated in that place, 20 degrees, and 55 minutes, South from the Aequator: in longitude from <hi>Mauritius</hi> 1 degree and a halfe: (but diſtant thence, ſeven and thirty Duch leagues:) and variation of the Compaſſe 23 degrees: an Ile exceeding lofty, made fying her aſpiring fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head within the middle Region: every where greene, and ever floriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; pleaſantly apparelled in various liveries; eſpecially in ſtore of trees, branching gallantly, and mounting to a rare ſublimity. It had no Creature in it, ſave birds; till our Captaine landed ſome Hogs and Goats of both kinds, that by a happy multiplication and encreaſe the future Paſſenger might be releeved and bleſſe the Planter. It wants not water, ſweet and plentifull: the freſh ſtreams are Magazeins of watry Citizens, ſuch as ſport themſelves in that liquid Element: 'twere prolixity to name halfe of them; the Eeles are notable; many there be, and moſt weigh thirty pounds; not odious in their corpulency, for to the taſt they render themſelves ſweet, moiſt, and excellent: the birds are many, rare, but moſt of them ſuch as are ſpoken of in the <hi>Mauritius.</hi>

But, long thoſe happy Favonii con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued not: the wind veered into other (our contrary) quarters; the Skie ore-ſpread with black and lowring clowds, the Sea roar'd and labour'd in many dreadfull tumors, threatning ſpight, and no ſmall danger: for ſeaven whole dayes and nights the Tempeſt raged, and forced us all that while to lye by the Lee (to ſpeake Sea language) no ſaile but the mizzen daring to oppoſe, the reſt made proſtrate to a ſenceleſſe furie: howbeit, the old ſong <hi>Venit poſt multos una ſerena Dies</hi> revived us, by a continued patience begetting freedome and victory.</p>
               <p>For many hundred miles we had nothing bat Sea and Ayre to feaſt our ſights with: ſomwhat bettered by many ſhoales of fiſh every where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitating us, now and then by too much greedineſſe proffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the deceitfull bait of the cunning Marriner. In this vacancie, I may remember; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 2 <hi>lib. Meteor</hi> is of opinion, that no great blaſts of wind blow from the South; meaning, that the burning Zone is without much raine, and clouds, ſuch as conduce to exhalation and vapours: or, that before they can exceed the Tropicks, and enter the temperate Zone, the Sunnes vehement and continued heat and rays diſpell, annihilate, and make them unforceable. Doubtleſſe he retracted; for who ſees not, that <hi>Phoebus</hi> in his attractive power (ſo, the matter be alike) equally co-operates towards a generation of wind and raine in his progreſſe unto either Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick. Experience, the Miſtreſſe of Knowledge taught it us; we found it ſo: for from the South many guſts and ſtormes aſſailed us. <hi>Ovid</hi> in his 4 <hi>lib. de Ponto</hi> is of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion (to be granted in our Hemiſpheare.)</p>

               <head>Of Helena.</head>
               <p>SAINT HELENA is an Ile, &amp; was in-nominate till <hi>Iohn de Nova</hi> gave it one, in the yeare after th'incarnation of our Saviour Chriſt 1502: and ſo named, for that he diſcovered it (in this returne from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Lisbon</hi>) the third of May; a day conſecrated to the memory of <hi>Helena</hi> the Empreſſe: She that firſt found the Croſſe, ſhe that was the moſt religious of Ladies in her time, ſhe that was mother to the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine:</hi> both of them glorious to the world; <hi>Brittans</hi> both; both bright Jems of this our Nation.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Helena</hi> is removed South from the Aequator ſixteene degrees: has longitude from the utmoſt promontory of South <hi>Africk,</hi> two and twenty degrees: the needle varies there, five degrees and thirteene minutes From the lands end of <hi>England</hi> is diſtant 1500 leagues, or 4500 Engliſh miles: From the Cape of <hi>Good hope</hi> 580 leagues, or 1740 miles. From <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſcar</hi> 1000 leagues, or 3000 miles. From <hi>Surat</hi> 2200 leagues, or 6600 miles. And from <hi>Bantam</hi> in <hi>Iava</hi> 2300 leagues, or 6900 miles, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. The Ile has this front in that Bay which takes name from the Chappell, nigh which we anchored.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>The Ile is hard to be aſcended; not that the paſſage is craggie, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitious: the Sailers Proverb of it is, A man may chooſe whither he will break his heart going up, or his neck in comming down; a merry jeaſt, but let them chooſe it. Once up, no place yeelds a more delightfull object. It is even and plaine above, ſwelling no where to a deformed riſing; cloath'd with ſweet graſſe, long and curious; every where it gives a large proſpect and horizon into the Ocean. The Springs above are ſweet, but below are brackiſh; the reaſon is, they participate (in their drilling diſcent) of the ſalt hills, through which it cuts a paſſage; ſalt both by their owne compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and the ſalt breath the Sea perpetually evaporates. There are but two rivolets in that Ile: the one bubbles down into the Chappell, th'other into the Lemmon Vallyes. They take their names fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Lemon tree whence it ariſes, and an old Chappell built at the very bottome by the Spaniard <hi>Anno</hi> 1571, and delapidated by the Dutch; a place once intended for Gods glory, but by malice of rude man made ruinous and a prophane neſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane avarice. The ruines of a little Towne demoliſht lately ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſerve to teſtifie a like Fate makes men and Villages dye, Death and deſtruction makes both mortall and miſerable. Some ſay the Spaniſh King ſubverted it, in that it became an unlawfull Magazein of Sea-mens Traffick, turning and returning out of both the Indyes: thereby loſing his tribute in too apparent meaſure. It is but lately made ſociable: the world is but beginning there; no Monuments, no Antique rarities are there found. You ſee all, if you looke upon the ſhatterd ribs of an old weather beaten Carrique, and ſome broken peeces of great Ordnance left there againſt the Owners good liking, and ſerve now in ſtead of Anchors. The Ile is deſolate of reaſonable Inhabitants: Hoggs and Goats dwell there: they agree well-favouredly, and multiply in mighty numbers; happy in their eaſe and ſafety, till ſhips arrive there to baniſh hunger: wee got alſo other good refreſhment; Pheſants, Powts, Quailes, Henns, Partrich; and (which were as acceptable) divers ſorts of graſſe &amp; roots, Wood-ſorrell, three-leav'd-graſſe, Baſil, Parſly, Mints, Spinage, Fennel, Annys, Radiſh, Muſtard-ſeed, Tobacco, and ſome others, which by a willing hand, directed by an ingenious eye, may ſoone be gathered: brought hither, and here ſowne by <hi>Fernandus Lupius</hi> an honeſt Portugall, in the yeare of our Lord 1509. whoſe Country-men at this day dare hardly land there to over-ſee their Seminary, or owne their labours; leſt the Engliſh or Hollander in the churliſh language of a Cannon queſtion them. <hi>Anno</hi> 1588 <hi>Candiſh</hi> our Country-man landed here in his circum-navigating the earth: I name him in this reſpect; he reports, he found here ſtore of Lemmons, Orenges, Pomgranads, Pomcitrons, Figgs, Dates &amp;c. but now are none of theſe fruits growing there that I could ſee or heare of, a Lemmon tree excepted;
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:20354:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to conclude, here wee buried in the old Chappell our honeſt Captaine <hi>Andrew Evans:</hi> his deaths wound (as I have told you) was given him by a fiſh at the <hi>Mauritius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Hellena</hi> was a pleaſant place, but bad for us to ſtay too long in: after ſix dayes commorance, wee paid our reckning in a hearty Farwell, and by benefit of a happy gale cut ſwiftly the yeelding billowes in a North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt courſe; whereby, on the ſixteenth of October wee made our ſelves Nadyr to the Sunne, at that time in his Progreſſe towards the Antartique Tropick: our latitude was 13 deg. and 13 min: the third day after that we got ſight of <hi>Aſcention Ile,</hi> nam'd ſo by <hi>Iohn de Nova</hi> in the yeare 1502: 'tis removed South from the Equinoctiall Circle ſeven degrees, 40 minutes: in circuit it is 30 Engliſh miles; from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hellens</hi> Ile removed ſeven hundred and twenty: little in it ſave wood and water, obſervable.</p>
               <p>On the ſeven and twentieth day we croſt under the Aequator; whence, to nine degrees North latitude wee were peſterd with continuall Torna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes; a variable weather, compos'd of lowd blaſts, ſtinking ſhowers, and terrible thunders. The eleventh of November we were parallel to <hi>Cape de Verd,</hi> and with the GORGADES, Iſles famouſed by antient Poets, who ſay, that the three Gorgons, <hi>Meduſa, Stenia,</hi> and <hi>Euryale,</hi> the daughters of of King <hi>Phorcys Neptunes</hi> ſonne here lived, and by the tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of their beauties (their yellow haires curling like Snakes, and deſhevelling about their naked ſhoulders) turn'd the beholders into a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid admiration, and by <hi>Perſeus</hi> his report of that their faculty gave Poets ſome ground whereon to build their fiction. Leaving thoſe, wee ſteered Weſtward, and paſt by many parts of the New found world (as ſome men call it) <hi>Guiana, Florida, Virginia, Nova Anglia,</hi> (parts of <hi>Norumbega</hi>) and the gulph of <hi>Mexico:</hi> where I have ſeated my ſelfe a while, and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the Reader of ſome patience, by travelling to find out the firſt Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer: a Queſtion not a little controverted.</p>

From an innate deſire to travell, and to avoid domeſtique broiles he put that in action which ſome old prophetique ſayings gave him light and encouraged him in. 'Tis very like he had read <hi>Plato</hi> (for what part of the world has ever more affected learning than the <hi>Britians</hi>) who in his Dialogue 'twixt <hi>Tymeus</hi> and <hi>Cricius,</hi> diſcourſes of a great vaſt Ile, Weſt from the Atlantique Ocean, and named ATLAS: as bigg as <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> put together. Some Humination hee had alſo out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> their Books of Rarities writ two thouſand yeares agoe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating how ſome Merchants paſſing thorow the Straits of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> were by tempeſt driven whither wind and Sea compelled them, ſo farre Weſt that they finally diſcried land, but un inhabited: It may be 'twas ſome of the <hi>Azores:</hi> but what ere it was, it proved a Magnet of encouragement to illure future Ages to diſcover Weſtward, and doubtleſſe was a prime cauſe of finding out the Weſterne Continent. <hi>Hanno</hi> alſo is ſuppoſed to have landed there. Queſtionleſſed he adventured farre (far in regard they had no Compaſſe to returne by) into the Atlantique Seas; but which way he ſail'd is diſputable: Weſt, ſome say: ſome say, Southward. <hi>Pomponius Mele</hi> and <hi>Lampridus</hi> affirme the land was South from <hi>Carthage</hi> hee diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; if South, then no part of the Weſt-Indies: the Canary Iles perhaps, the <hi>Atlantiades,</hi> the <hi>Gorgades, Ascention,</hi> or Saint <hi>Helens;</hi> who though they carry not the Epithite of Great, yet the Novelty conſidered, and the Diſtance, the word great may be affected. Some (but I beleeve them not) carry him to <hi>Madagaſcar:</hi> if that, hee diſcovered a great Ile indeed; But then ſure he would have found out the Red Sea (not comparable to the dangers he had paſt, in doubling Cape <hi>Tormentoſo</hi>) and made his journey home, leſſe dangerous. <hi>Virgil</hi> the beſt of Latine Poets, from ſome vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinating Notion ſeemes to point at it, in the 6. <hi>lib.

               <p>He was brother to Prince <hi>David,</hi> ſonnes of that famous <hi>Owen Gwynedd</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who for above thirty yeeres governed wiſely, with great courage and good fortune: his Father was <hi>Gruffith ap Conan</hi> that did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for ſome lands in <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour at S. <hi>Davids:</hi> and deſcended lineally from King <hi>Rodri</hi> Mawr (or <hi>Roderic</hi> the great) glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in many, conflicts and victories againſt the ſavage <hi>Saxon;</hi> in thoſe foure great battells eſpecially, at <hi>Berthem, Bangelu, Monegid,</hi> and <hi>Angleſea,</hi> in the yeere from <hi>Adam</hi> 4820: from the nativity of our Bleſſed Saviour 846. ſuch time as <hi>Burchred</hi> King of <hi>Mercia, Athelwolfe</hi> King of the Weſt-Sayſſes, <hi>Meiric</hi> and other valiant Princes by ſad tryall found him fortunate: which ſuffice to illuſtrate <hi>Madock's</hi> quality, every way exceeding honourable.</p>

But a ſupream power and Juſtice would not eſtabliſh it againſt right and reaſon, for ſo ſoone as <hi>Llewellyn</hi> (<hi>Iorwerths</hi> ſonne and right heyre) was capable to graſp it, hee drew many of <hi>Davids</hi> men to his party (ſuch is the vulgars levity) promiſing them great matters; and ayded by <hi>Howell ap Meredith</hi> and <hi>Conan ap Owen</hi> his active kinſmen, <hi>David</hi> unwillingly deſcends from his Princely Seat, and <hi>Llewellyn</hi> is ſeated <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1194; not without much blood-ſhed and diſtraction of the wiſeſt.</p>

day in danger: all things therefore being fitted, he put to Sea without bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his kindred farewell, leaſt too much love or hate might have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne him. The yeere he ſet forth in, was from <hi>Adam</hi> 5140. from <hi>Chriſt</hi> 1170. the wind and ſea ſeemed to favour him (Omens of good fortune:) ſo as, after ſome patience and weeks ſaile due Weſt, hee deſcried land, a land where he found ſtore of good victualls, ſweet water, freſh ayre, gold, (and which was beſt) where they were a good whiles healthfull: ſuch, as over-whelmed him with joy, but moderated when he conſidered how Almighty God was alike powerfull and gratious in all places: his exile now turned into comfort. In leiw of ingeminating his owne miſery, hee joyes himſelfe, and ſees his brothers moſt unhappy Princes; who ſo eagerly emulated one anothers greatneſſe: a Territory cauſing it, which compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which this, God had directed him to, was but as a handfull of earth, and which he had had poſſeſſion of without oppoſition or bloodſhed. Here <hi>Madoc</hi> planted (in <hi>Florida</hi> or <hi>Canada,</hi> ſome part of <hi>Mexico</hi>) rais'd ſome fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for defence, left a hundred and twenty men (I follow the old Copie, in this Storie) and directly by Gods providence (the beſt compaſſe) and benefit of the Pole ſtarre after long ſaile arrived ſafely at home; where, hee recounted his mervailous ſuccesfull voyage, the fruitfulneſſe of the ſoile, the ſimplicity of the Savages, the great wealth abounding there, and facility of Conqueſt: a diſcourſe that fill'd them with joy and admiration; and whereby hee drew many willing minds to returne with him. In ten good Barques, loaded with all neceſſary proviſions they advanced back, and moſt fortunately re-attained the ſame place they hoped for. Great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing was among them at that their happineſſe, but no leſſe ſorrow fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: for, being come to the Plantation, they found few of thoſe they left there, living: cauſed by too much eating, the indiſpoſition or Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that ayre arid climate, (which though never ſo excellent, yet cauſes ſickneſſe and alteration in new Inhabitants) by ſome trecherie of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. <hi>Madoc</hi> digeſted it with a Chriſtian fortitude and patience, and forth-with bettered the Colony, by help of <hi>Eneon</hi> and <hi>Edwall</hi> his brothers Contriving every thing with ſo good order, that they were ſecure from any Enemie, and had all things conducing to eaſe, plenty, and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: they threw away the too indulgent thoughts of their Native homes, by this reaſon, that if they died there, they were in the ſame diſtance from heaven, and had as eaſie a journey thither: what moſt afflicted them was the breach of promiſe, many of their friends had made but not performed. The cauſe was not in them, but in the overture of that ſtate turn'd topſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turvie by the <hi>Brittaine</hi> Princes, and totally by the indiſcretion of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Prince <hi>Lluellyn ap Gryffith,</hi> (lately married to <hi>Eleoner,</hi> daughter of <hi>Monteford</hi> the bold Earle of <hi>Leceſter</hi> and <hi>Eleoner</hi> daughter of King <hi>Iohn</hi>) which <hi>Gruffyth</hi> was ſlaine <hi>Anno</hi> 1282 at <hi>Buelht</hi> by <hi>Franckton</hi> an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in an unmanly faſhion. So that <hi>Madoc</hi> and his Company returned no more, nor did the Welſh ſaile thither afterward, whereby one of another in ſmall time were in ſome ſort forgotten and never remembred.</p>
               <p>But although <hi>Madoc</hi> and his Cambrian crew are dead and their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moath-eaten; yet the foot-ſteeps and reliques of their former living there are to be traced; and ſuch, as deſerve to be revived clearly: the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

they left there, the religion they taught the Savages, manifeſted it; otherwiſe how come those many Brittiſh words (not much altred from the dialect) amongſt the Mexicans? whence had they the uſe of Beads, of Crucifixes, of Reliques &amp;c? all which the Spaniards (as we tcad in <hi>Lopez de Gomera</hi> and others) confeſſe they found amongſt the Canibals, and thoſe of <hi>Acuſano,</hi> and <hi>Culhuacan</hi> at their firſt landing in <hi>America.</hi> Yea, ſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and reports amongſt the Mexicans, that (about the time that <hi>Madoc</hi> was there) a ſtrange people came thither in Corraughs or Ships, who taught them ſome knowledge of God, and by whoſe examples they became more civill and induſtrious: teſtified by <hi>Columbus, Franciſcus Lopez, Coz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezo, Poſtellus</hi> and other Caſtilians of quality; that of <hi>Fernando Cortez,</hi> (<hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1519 Ambaſſador and Generall for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabell</hi>) is alſo remarkable. In ſome diſcourſe betwixt him and <hi>Mutezuma</hi> (ſecond ſonne of <hi>Antzol,</hi> and Father of <hi>Quabutimoc</hi> laſt King of <hi>Mexico,</hi>) the Ambaſſador obſerving the Indians to have many ceremonies the Spaniards uſed, demanded of the King who firſt inſtructed them, who anſwered <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez;</hi> That many yeeres ago a ſtrange Nation landed there, a civill people, and from examples of piety they received them; but how they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or whence they came he could not ſatisfie him. Another time, in an Oration of thanks which <hi>Mutezuma</hi> returned them for ſome favours, hee thus told them. One chiefe cauſe of my eſpeciall affection to your Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this, I have many times heard my Father ſay, hee heard his Grandſire ſeriouſly affirme (out of a continued tradition) That not many Deſcents above him, his Progenitors came thither as ſtrangers by accident, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of a Noble man, who abode there a while and then departed, but left many of his people behind him; and that upon his returne, moſt of thoſe he left, died: and that from him or ſome of them they thought they themſelves diſcended. A ſpeech agreeing with our Narration: and that this people were Welſh rather than Spaniards, or others, the Records of this voyage writ by many Bardhs and Genealogiſts confirme it; memoriz'd alſo by thoſe learned Poets <hi>Cynwric op Grono</hi> and <hi>Guten Owen</hi> (who lived in <hi>Edward</hi> the fourths time) and by Sir <hi>Meredith ap Reeſe</hi> a valiant and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, living in the yeare 1477. and of <hi>Madoc</hi> in this Eulogie.

Enough to ſatisfie the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers of truth; too mush foe Zolliſts and ſuch as delight in oppoſition. This, no doubt had it beene ſo deſervedly knowne and Catholiquely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeved as it merited; then had not <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> (a man in truth, honourable and iduſtrious) <hi>Americus Veſpuſius, Magellan,</hi> nor others ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along with them all the honour in ſo great an enterpriſe: Nor had Prince <hi>Madoc</hi> beene defrauded of his memory, nor our Kings of their juſt right and Title to the Weſt Indyes (a ſecret fate as it were miraculouſly renuing their claime by <hi>Columbus</hi> his proffering the diſcoverie and wealth of thoſe Countries to our King <hi>H.</hi> 7.) nor then had his Holineſſe, nor his Catholique Majeſtie had that plea nor immediate Intereſt grounded upon the Genoans diſcovery, as many Jeſuits and State-politiques have ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, ſo late diſputed for. Farre be it from me or any honeſt man to detract <hi>Columbus,</hi> or to derogate from his deſerved glory: It may be his diſcovery was (as <hi>Madocks</hi> was) meerely from his owne skill, genius, and magnanimity, without knowledge of <hi>Madocks</hi> former being there, or of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from old conjectures: his greateſt reaſon I know, was that ſo much of the 360 degrees could ſcarce be Ocean &amp; that he might as well diſcover Weſtward as the Portugalls had done Eaſt to the other Indies. But this I would withall have alſo granted; That this his voyage was after the other (of our Country-man) three hundred and two &amp; twenty yeares; and that the Spaniards have not ſo much right to thoſe Countries (I meane of <hi>America</hi>) as our King has; ſo long as they arrogate their claime from a primier diſcovery.</p>

Whither <hi>Columbus</hi> had any illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from old Poets, or that he had ſeene or heard of <hi>Madocks</hi> journey Weſtward, who knowes: for, what Nation formerly knew not the acts of Engliſh-men better than themſelves: otherwiſe, <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> that craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Monck had not andertooke to illuſtrate (to his and our ſhame) the Engliſh Cronologie, nor <hi>Verſtegan</hi> (alias <hi>Rowley</hi>) dar'd to make us all Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicks; from both which wee ſuck to many egregious falſhoods. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi> armed with much confidence, ſends his brother to our King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, the wiſeſt in his time and moſt noble, if too much avarice had not ſwayed him: whoſe ill hap it was to ſlight the Meſſenger and his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, from his incredulous heart and the poverty of <hi>Columbus,</hi> who in his paſſage had been impriſoned by Reſcalls, and nakedly (after much intreaty) delivered. Upon the Kings refuſall, he deſired the French King to Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize it, but hee (hearing that King <hi>Henry</hi> had refused) derided him; who
